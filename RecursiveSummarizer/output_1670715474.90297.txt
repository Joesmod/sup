The Resurrection Project's Vicki Aroyo and the Department of Housing's Natasha Hamilton introduce themselves to the committee. Aroyo has 15 years of experience in community development banking, while Hamilton has a background in education. They are both excited to be a part of the Department of Housing's work to ensure all Chicagoans have access to equitable housing.

The Department of Public Health's Colleen Mahoney is appointed to the Chicago Low Income Housing Trust Fund Board. The board is responsible for providing housing for vulnerable Chicagoans.

The city of Chicago is selling a parcel of land to the Comer science and education foundation for $13,000. The land will be used as an athletic field for the Gary Comer college prep school and youth center.

The Gary Comer Science Education Foundation is selling two parcels of land to the By the Hand Club for Kids for $24,500. The By the Hand Club is a nonprofit corporation that operates the Ferdinand Community Center and Moving Everest Charter School in Austin.

The by the hand club will be purchasing two properties - 5216 West Ferdinand for $12,500 and 5223 West Ferdinand for $12,000. They will be using these properties for the school camp and for by the hand offices. They have already completed an environmental assessment for the property and are working on getting demolition permits to clear the site. The department has reviewed the proposal and recommends approval.

The city of Austin is selling a parcel of land to the Boys and Girls Club, which includes three houses. The Club plans to demolish the houses and use the land for a garden or similar purpose.

The city of Chicago is selling a vacant lot for $9,300 to SBSS LLC, which plans to build an eight-unit residential building on the property. The lot is located in the 25th Ward on the West Side of Chicago.

The city of Chicago is selling a piece of property on the West Side to a developer who plans to build an eight-unit residential building. There are no affordable units included in the development.

The city is considering selling 20 lots to a redevelopment company in order to construct affordable housing. The council will vote on the matter at their next meeting.

The Department of Housing is requesting approval to sell 20 parcels of land in the 27th Ward for the development of up to 21 single-family homes. The land is valued at $429,000, or $695 per square foot. Inhabitants of the homes will be working families.

The city of Chicago is planning to build six new single-family homes on Lawndale Avenue, five new single-family homes on Ohio Street, and two more on Monticello. The homes will be modular, meaning they will be built in a factory and then shipped to the site. This should help to speed up the construction process and create quality housing for the community.

The city of Chicago is investing in affordable housing to help working class homeowners. The facilities will be up and running by summertime.

The city is interested in modular housing as a way to bring down costs and build housing more effectively. The zoning for modular housing is RT, and the city is working with a developer to create a two-flat model. The goal is to encourage more modular development in the city.

Walter Burnett Jr. is excited about a new development by Tim King of West Side pioneer group, which will help change the face of the West Side. The project will include affordable housing units and will teach people in the community how to get into the construction industry.

The city is selling seven lots to R&D Develop Builders LLC for the construction of affordable homes in the South Shore and Kellyman Heights community areas. This is part of the city's "Lights for Working Families" program.

The amendment will add one two-unit home for town homes and single family detached homes to the existing nine homes in the ward. The seventh ward is a very vibrant area with a lot of housing, but it is difficult to find enough contiguous or close enough lots to meet the city's minimum requirements. The proposed home at 2716 76th Street will have no alley access, and the four townhomes at the southwest corner of 76 and Saginaw will be the last homes in the ward. The two units on 93rd Street will have three bedrooms, and the single family home at 9230 South Clyde will also have three bedrooms. This concludes the testimony, and Alderman Mitchell is supportive of the project.

The committee adjourns with a recommendation to pass an ordinance at the next city council meeting.
