The text contains a roll call of members present for a government meeting, followed by public comment. The first public speaker, Kennedy Bartley, is advocating for a budget amendment for the Chicago Social Justice Memorial.

The text discusses the need for a Chicago Social Justice Memorial to commemorate survivors of police torture, who are predominantly black and Latinx. Seven years ago, legislation was passed to provide reparations for these survivors, but only one of the eight demands has been fulfilled. The author argues that the delay in justice is demoralizing to those who are trying to be civically engaged.

Mark Clements, a victim of police torture in 1981, is requesting that the budget committee build a memorial for victims of police torture. He says that the decision to build the memorial on the south side of Chicago was a collective one reached by survivors of police torture, and that the memorial is needed to help the traumatized community heal.

The text discusses the need for a Chicago torture justice center, which would help those who have been affected by police torture. The author asks the City Council to approve funding for the center.

The text discusses a budget amendment that would provide $2.25 million for a Chicago torture justice memorial. The amendment is necessary because survivors of police torture are passing away and the lack of funding for the memorial is traumatizing them.

The text discusses the problem of impassable sidewalks in Chicago during winter. It is difficult for parents with strollers and people with limited mobility to get around, and this problem is exacerbated by the fact that the city does not clear sidewalks. The author urges the city to clear sidewalks, as this would benefit all residents.

She argues that the city should budget for a pilot program to clear sidewalks, as this would improve quality of life for many people. Claire Falk, a mother of three, then describes how difficult it is to navigate Chicago with young children in a stroller when sidewalks are covered in snow and ice.

Abla Garib, a motorized wheelchair user, lives in the city and is urging the City Council to fund plowing the sidewalks. She has had to cancel social plans, family plans, trips to the grocery store, and even trips to the doctor because she cannot get to the end of her block in her wheelchair. Many of her neighbors are elderly or living with a disability and cannot plow their sidewalks.

Chicago residents are asking for a $750,000 pilot to clear snow and ice from municipal sidewalks. Only two thirds of Chicagoans use a car to get around, yet 100% of the city streets are cleared. This affects all Chicagoans, as all of us use the sidewalk day to day to get around. Thank you very much for your comments.

The text describes the work of Better Street Chicago, a campaign to reduce car dependency in the city. One of the ways they are working to achieve this is by making sidewalks more accessible in the winter. The campaign has received many emails from people, including parents, about the difficulties they face when sidewalks are not shoveled. The text also discusses the city council's approval of $12.5 million for the Chicago MOOST program, which has been criticized for giving money to oil and gas companies instead of investing in infrastructure that would make the city more accessible for everyone.

The text discusses a proposed pilot program to plow sidewalks in Chicago. The speaker argues that the program would benefit people of all ages, races, genders, and mobilities.

The text contains a discussion about a city council meeting. The speaker is angry that the council members are not doing their jobs properly.

Alderman Osterman is asking the Managing Deputy of Finance and Human Resources to partner with the city to find housing for migrants and the homeless before winter.

The text discusses the work of the Aldermanic Information Systems (AIS) department in Chicago, and the importance of technology in efficient city service delivery. AIS is taking the lead on identifying efficient IT solutions for the city, and the Economic Capital Technology Committee is aggressive in finding ways to save money and improve service delivery. The author is excited about the new Acting Commissioner's appointment and looks forward to working with him to implement strategic IT upgrades.

Alderman Capelman supports the idea of using vacant rectories and convents for housing, as it aligns with the mission of the Roman Catholic Church to help those who are most vulnerable.

Alderman Hairston congratulates Acting Commissioner Blake Moore on her appointment and asks if she is related to George Blake Moore.

The text discusses a policy prohibiting city employees from texting with Alderman, and whether or not there is an automatic reply set up for text messages. It also mentiones the need for ward-specific tax ID numbers, to help with continuity when turnover happens.

Alderman Brookins asks about the cost of renovations for the city of Chicago and the quality of care for individuals housed by the AIS department. The Commissioner of the Department of Family and Support Services says that these questions can be addressed after the meeting.

Alderman Harris is requesting a transfer of $7,000 from the rental equipment and graphic design budgets to the material and supplies budget for her committee. This is necessary because committee meetings are now being held in person.

-The budget for the committee of rules needs to be transferred in order to pass supplies. -The substitute ordinance for item number three on the agenda concerning the transfer of funds within the committee on economic capital and technology development is for $6,000. -The do pass recommendation for item number four on the agenda will report it out at the next city council meeting.

A resolution has been introduced calling for the Illinois General Assembly to make central vote centers permanent in future election-related legislation. This would make it easier for people to vote and help to ensure that elections are fair and accurate.

The city of Chicago has permanent early voting centers that are open on election day. This is a convenient option for voters who may not be able to make it to their assigned precinct polling place. The city is hoping that the state legislature will make this permanent so that early voting centers can continue to be used as vote centers on election day.

The city council is discussing a resolution to make voting easier for residents of Illinois. They are considering increasing the number of early voting sites from 50 to 100. Alderman Austin encourages the board of elections to let people know that they can vote early if they are confused about their polling place on election day.

Alderman Austin is proposing a resolution to expand voting rights and increase access to voting sites and early voting in the city of Chicago. Alderman Tunney expresses concern about voter confusion and turnout on election day, and asks for a commitment from the city to provide rapid responses to questions and concerns from voters.

The Chicago Board of Elections is expecting confusion on election day due to changes in ward boundaries and consolidated polling places. They are urging voters to check their voting information ahead of time on their website or by calling the Board of Elections. They have increased staffing for election day and are prepared for additional attrition in the days leading up to the election.

The Chicago Board of Elections is preparing for a busy election day, with many people unsure of their polling place. They are urging people to check their polling place in advance, and will have extra resources available on election day. However, they are expecting some confusion and frustration among voters.

The resolution is to support the consolidation of precincts in the city of Chicago. This will help reduce the number of people in each precinct and make it easier for people to vote. The next step is to work with the Board of Election to make sure this gets before the right people, including the governor.

The Department of Housing and the Department of Public Health are requesting additional federal grant funds to help with migrant families and individuals experiencing homelessness. The funds will be used for rental assistance payments, health care, and public health surveillance.

The Department of Public Health is requesting to accept additional state grant funds in the amount of $20,000 from the Illinois Department of Public Health for the body art and tanning inspection program. The funds are used to provide basic levels of protection of infectious diseases and body and tanning facilities across the city to meet the health code regulations. This increase in funds supports additional facility inspections that were closed during the pandemic complaints are received through 311 as well as various random and routine inspections violations are reported to the Department of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection.

The Illinois Department of Public Health is requesting funds to screen clients for HIV risk, connect them with prescribers for access to the PR EP program, and provide navigational services and medication adherence support. The goal is to increase the number of at-risk people accessing the medication and decrease the number of new cases of HIV infection. The mayor's office is also requesting funds to address gender-based violence experienced by people with disabilities. The Department of Family Support Services is requesting funds to support coordinated services for additional outreach services by delegate agencies to support unsheltered residents who are utilizing trains and other CTA spaces for shelter.

The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) is allocating $2 million for outreach to the homeless population, which is in addition to the funds already being spent by the Department of Family and Support Services. This is the first time that CTA has dedicated funds specifically for this purpose. HIV and COVID vaccines will also be offered as part of this outreach effort.

The City of Chicago has received a grant from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to remediate lead and other hazards in 335 homes by 2026. This is the largest such allocation from HUD, and will allow the city to address a significant number of homes with lead poisoning prevention.

Alderman Riley proposes an ordinance to pass the 925 budget recommendation. All those in favor signify by saying "I" in the opinion of the chair, the eyes have it, and the do pass recommendation for this item number six will be reported out at the next city council meeting. Item seven a and seven be on the agenda. Thank you.

The city of Chicago is proposing the creation of a new office with various responsibilities related to sustainability and veterans affairs. The new office will be budgeted for 10 positions, including a chief sustainability officer, grants research specialists, and project managers. Additionally, four new positions will be added to the homeless services division within the Department of Family Support Services, and a new director position will be created to lead the assistance for the city's new arrivals initiative. Finally, various technical adjustments and corrections will be made in various departments.

The city is considering creating a new Office of Climate and Environmental Equity, which would study the need for a separate Department of Environment. This is seen as a first step towards potentially creating a more robust Department of Environment in the future.

The city is considering creating a new pollution control department, and one council member advocates starting with a small department and growing it over time. Another council member suggests increasing hours for the existing streets and sanitation department to help address pollution control issues.

The city is budgeting for 26,000 hours of pool work or temporary work as part of its initial budget. The goal is to get these workers in place by April. The Office of Climate and Environmental Equity will have enforcement authority over the department.

The city is discussing the possibility of creating a Department of Environment, and part of that discussion will include the costs of switching from a contractor-based garbage collection system to a city-run system. The city is also looking at the possibility of creating an Office of Climate and Environmental Equity, which would be run by the Chief Sustainability Officer.

The Office of Climate and Environmental Equity is responsible for coordinating the city's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and advance environmental and sustainability priorities. The office reports to the chief sustainability officer, who is charged with strategic coordination across all sectors and departments.

The idea of strategically planning includes the alderman, according to the speaker. They have created many processes by which alderman have been engaged and are proud of the work they have done. The budget for this department will be discussed with the Council before it is finalized.

The mayor's office budget is equal. The administration talked about re implementing a department environment, but has not done so. This budget does not include a Department of Environment, which was promised to the people of the city of Chicago.

The budget for the City of Chicago includes $8.9 million for ShotSpotter technology, which is a sound-based system for detecting and locating gunfire. Studies have cast doubt on the efficacy of this technology, but the city has continued to fund it.

The alderman is disappointed with the budget, because it doesn't allocate enough money to mental health first responders and ShotSpotter, a program designed to reduce gun violence. She also has questions about a proposed study on the city's Department of Environment.

The city is looking to study how to best combine different roles and responsibilities within the city in order to create a more efficient governance structure. The study will be conducted with input from stakeholders and city leadership, and will be funded by CCA (pro bono).

The question is about the accountability to get this done in six months, and the answer is that states are responsible for this. The date is set so that they can be accountable to make sure that they hit that date and bring that before you. The appropriation for the female appropriation for reimbursements or, you know, funding for asylum seekers is 16 million to get us through the end of this year.

The budget for the mayor's office includes a new position for a director of veteran affairs. This is in addition to the five other positions that were already included in the budget. Some positions have been moved from the mayor's office to the Office of Climate and Environmental Equity.

Alderman Austin is proposing a budget amendment for the Chicago Office of Veteran Affairs, in order to provide more services for returning veterans. The amendment includes increased funding for rapid rehousing, to get more veterans off the street and into housing.

The city is working on increasing outreach for the homeless and adding a community liaison position to help bridge the divide between the police and communities. They are also working on creating a full-blown Department of Environment.

The administration is considering adding a Department of Environment and an office of gun violence prevention, both of which would be funded in the budget. Council members support these additions, citing the importance of water and climate change on the west coast, and the need for gun violence prevention in light of recent mass shootings.

The speaker discusses the lack of a specific office or department for gun violence prevention in the city, and notes that funding for violence prevention efforts comes from a variety of sources. They express a desire to see more money allocated to gun violence prevention, and suggest that an office or department specifically devoted to this issue would be helpful.

The CRP has 15 million set aside for the expansion of the care in program, which is a pilot program being expanded. They have not yet spent the 2 million allocated in the corporate fund for the expansion, which will happen in 2023.

The city is looking to expand its Community Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) program over the next few years. This will include adding new teams, expanding geographically, and adding second shifts.

The city of Chicago is planning to add additional teams to address substance abuse and other needs in the coming year. The funding for this will come from the AARP fund, which will last until 2026. Additionally, there is money allocated in the budget for lead line replacement.

The budget for the lead service line replacement program is 60 million, and CPS is allocated a small portion of that. There is no current programming specifically for police retention, but the budget director says that they are working on it as part of the $100 million investment for the police department.

The city has received ARPA funds for pandemic relief, and the budget needs to take into account what is left of those funds. The expiration dates of the various grant programs need to be considered, and it is unclear why some projects are not moving forward despite the funding being available.

The City of Philadelphia is facing a problem with its environmental department. There is a lack of impact on the ground, despite increased resources being allocated to the department. One suggestion is to pivot to an environmental office, which would be better equipped to handle climate change.

The chief sustainability officer will be responsible for coordinating sustainability efforts across the city government. A deputy commissioner will help with this work, as well as six project managers and an administrative assistant. This office will be responsible for briefing the city council on progress and engaging with the public on sustainability initiatives.

The mayor has proposed the creation of an Office of the Environment, which will be approved by the city council. This office will be responsible for leading the way to a more robust department, with a focus on environmental protection and inequity. The council will vote on the appointment of a chief for this office at a later date.

The alderman is asking if George could maybe organize the contest of renaming the committee that doesn't exist before he walks out the door.

The Department of Environment is planning to start a justice project with the help of a pro bono study. The goal of the study is to figure out the best governance structure for the office, plus the Department of Environment, and to identify sustainable revenue sources.

The city of Chicago should explore sustainable revenue sources to maintain its environmental department in the long term. This study will scope the functions of the department and identify gaps and opportunities for capacity building. The study should be fully funded to provide real guidance on how to move forward with environmental issues in the city.

The Commissioner for the Department of Human Services wants to ensure that efficiencies are considered when it comes to funding violence prevention youth activities. They are looking into using public facilities more effectively and efficiently in order to save taxpayer money.

The city has budgeted for upgrading and improving public facilities, and for the social programming of agencies like CPS. However, the level of coordination between these agencies could be improved, especially when it comes to addressing issues like youth mental health.

The city of Chicago has increased its investment in mental health facilities and services, and as a result has more than doubled the number of people served and is on track to serve 75,000 people by the end of 2020.

The city of Chicago has appointed a team of five people to work full time on environmental issues, and has released a climate action plan outlining a series of strategies to improve the environment. Funding has been allocated in the Chicago recovery plan to climate and environmental justice priorities.

The City of Chicago is working hard to allocate funds equitably to leverage green jobs and new opportunities. They have also been working on a strategy to divert materials from the waste stream. They have just opened up a citywide compost network at community gardens. They are also planting trees in coordination with the Department of Public Health.

The Department of Environment is working on a community benefits agreement that will help fund community and workforce development. They are also exploring the possibility of creating a permanent department devoted to environment issues. This is a complicated issue that involves multiple departments, but the goal is to keep momentum going and make sure that evidence-based best practices are used.

In January 2021, the city of Chicago requested a study on what a department of the environment would look like. The study found that the city would benefit from having such a department, and that it would be a good investment. However, the city has not yet created such a department.

Item number eight on the agenda is an ordinance concerning expenditures of 2023. This ordinance will be explained by budget director Susie Park. Item number nine on the agenda is an ordinance approving an intergovernmental agreement with the Chicago Transit Authority in Cook County for the allocation of motor fuel tax funds to the Chicago Transit Authority as year 2023 matching grant pursuant to regional transportation authority act.

The City Council is voting on a measure to provide funding to the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA). Some members are reluctant to vote in favor of the measure because the CTA president has not been responsive to requests to appear before the Council. However, a letter from the CTA president confirming that he will appear on November 10th has persuaded some members to vote in favor of the measure.

The 2023 management ordinance amends various provisions of the municipal code regarding the organization and functions of city government. The ordinance codifies the existing mayor's office of equity and racial justice, and establishes the new office of climate and environmental equity. It also requires that a study be commissioned to assess the feasibility of creating a citywide department of environment and sustainability.

The bill authorizes the commissioner of assets information and services to include indemnification and right of entry agreements, clarifies that lobbyists who lobby elected or appointed city officers employees must cooperate with the office of the inspector general, allows the community commission for public safety and accountability to submit only one eligible candidate for reappointment in the case of an anticipated vacancy due to the expiration of a term, and gives diverse the same meaning as minority in sections two dash 92 dash 670 n in order to expand the definition to include the people indigenous to the Americas.

This ordinance removes obsolete language related to debt checks and payment plans for applicants for city employees employment, clarifies the ability of the office of labor standards to enforce worker protection laws, and establishes an administrative process for transfer of ownership of properties currently receiving out of city water service.

The city of Chicago is requiring lobbyists to cooperate with the city in regards to providing information and/or documents. This is in line with the city's existing code and is just a clarification.

The city has the authority to compel lobbyists to cooperate with the inspector general, without subpoena or something similar. This is done by registering as a lobbyist with the city. The mayor shall select a candidate or reject the candidates for reappointment to the police board within 30 days, and provide the commission with a written explanation if a reappointment candidate is selected.

The term "diverse" has been proposed as a replacement for "minority" in the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's (EEOC) guidelines. However, this change could actually result in further discrimination against minority groups, as the definition of "diverse" is much broader than the definition of "minority."

The city comptroller explains that the debt check section is for a process that the city already does for new employees, and that volunteers would not have to go through the debt check process as long as they're not a part of a commission. The office of labor standards appoints a commissioner and a director.

The Chicago Commissioner of Business Affairs and Consumer Protection is responsible for investigating complaints of wage theft and enforcing the city's labor standards. The Office of Labor Standards is expanding the definition of "worker" to include independent contractors, in order to better protect their rights. Violations of the labor standards will be adjudicated by the Department of Labor Standards or a judge in circuit court.

The city of Chicago is proposing a new fee for short-term rental companies that would be based on the number of units they have available for rent. For example, a company with one unit would pay a 250 dollar license fee plus 60 dollars for every host, for a total of 310 dollars. This is in addition to the 10,000 dollar fee that larger companies like Airbnb currently pay.

The city of Chicago is proposing a new fee for platforms that allow people to rent out their apartments, which would apply to companies like Airbnb. The fee would be $310 per unit, per year, and would go towards funding enforcement of the new regulations. Critics of the proposal say that it could burden small landlords who rent out their units to students or other short-term renters.

The speaker is asking why residents who rent out units to short-term tenants should have to pay the same registration fee as companies that operate short-term rentals. They argue that this is unfair to residents who are not in the business of renting out units and are just renting to tenants for a short period of time.

The department of environment is proposing to make the emergency procurement authority belonging to the chief procurement officer (CPO) a permanent power. The rationale for this is that the costs of goods and services have increased significantly in recent years, and a million dollars is not as much as it used to be. This would remove the council from a lot of conversations.

The city council is discussing a change that would give the city more oversight of transactions over 500,000. This change would take members of the city council out of a lot of conversations. The commissioner says that there are lots of transactions that fall in this range. The concern is that this is a big giveaway when it comes to city council oversight.

The alderman brought up a valid point about the responsibility of the elected officials to look out for the taxpayers. He also mentioned that a disparity study and other things should be done in order to make sure that the budget is fair. The chair agreed to take a five-minute recess in order to work on a substitute management ordinance.

The budget for this season includes an amendment for right now, but it is more just a point that the administration has had a lot of time to work on this and then it is dumped on us at the last minute and we're here to vote. Alderman Tony is questioning the salaries for the city clerk and city treasurer, but the only change is coming in for 2023. The salary rate for the mayor is the same as it is currently.

Alderman Toni believes that the CPI adjustment should happen every year, but Alderman Tony does not agree with that. There will be a five minute break while the law department is consulted on the matter.
