Write a concise summary of the following:

liberty supporting the abortion right has shifted yet again. Respondents and the United States propose no fewer than three different interests that supposedly spring from the Due Process Clause. They include bodily integrity, personal autonomy in matters of family, medical care, and faith, Brief for Respondents 21, and womens equal citizenship, Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24. That 50 years have passed since Roe and abortion advocates still cannot coherently articulate the right (or rights) at stake proves the obvious: The right to abortion is ultimately a policy goal in desperate search of a constitutional justification. Second, substantive due process distorts other areas of constitutional law. For example, once this Court identifies a fundamental right for one class of individuals, it invokes the Equal Protection Clause to demand exacting scrutiny of statutes that deny the right to others. See, e.g., Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438, 453454 (1972) (relying on Griswold to invalidate a state statute prohibiting distribution   6 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION THOMAS, J., concurring of contraceptives to unmarried persons). Statutory classifications implicating certain nonfundamental rights, meanwhile, receive only cursory review. See, e.g., Armour v. Indianapolis, 566 U. S. 673, 680 (2012). Similarly, this Court deems unconstitutionally vague or overbroad those laws that impinge on its preferred rights, while letting slide those laws that implicate supposedly lesser values. See, e.g., Johnson, 576 U. S., at 618621 (opinion of THOMAS, J.); United States v. Sineneng-Smith, 590 U. S. ___, ______ (2020) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (slip op., at 35). In fact, our vagueness doctrine served as the basis for the first draft of the majority opinion in Roe v. Wade, and it since has been deployed . . . to nullify even mild regulations of the abortion industry. Johnson, 576 U. S., at 620621 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). Therefore, regardless of the doctrinal context, the Court often demand[s] extra justifications for encroachments on preferred rights while relax[ing] purportedly higher standards of review for lesspreferred rights. Whole Womans Health v. Hellerstedt, 579 U. S. 582, 640642 (2016) (THOMAS, J., dissenting). Substantive due process is the core inspiration for many of the Courts constitutionally unmoored policy judgments. Third, substantive due process is often wielded to disastrous ends. Gamble, 587 U. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J., concurring) (slip op., at 16). For instance, in Dred Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 393 (1857), the Court invoked a species of substantive due process to announce that Congress was powerless to emancipate slaves brought into the federal territories. See id., at 452. While Dred Scott was overruled on the battlefields of the Civil War and by constitutional amendment after Appomattox, Obergefell, 576 U. S., at 696 (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting), that overruling was

RESPONSE:

The liberty supporting the abortion right has shifted yet again, with three different interests being proposed that supposedly spring from the Due Process Clause. These include bodily integrity, personal autonomy in matters of family, medical care, and faith, and womens equal citizenship. However, after 50 years since Roe, abortion advocates still cannot coherently articulate the right (or rights) at stake, proving that the right to abortion is ultimately a policy goal in desperate search of a constitutional justification.
