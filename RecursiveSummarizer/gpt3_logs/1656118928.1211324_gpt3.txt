for Respondents 18; Brief for United States 23–24. These attempts to justify abortion through appeals to a broader right to autonomy and to define one’s “concept of existence” prove too much. Casey, 505 U. S., at 851. Those criteria, at a high level of generality, could license fundamental rights to illicit drug use, prostitution, and the like. See Compassion in Dying v. Washington, 85 F. 3d 1440, 1444 (CA9 1996) (O’Scannlain, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). None of these rights has any claim to being deeply rooted in history. Id., at 1440, 1445. What sharply distinguishes the abortion right from the rights recognized in the cases on which Roe and Casey rely is something that both those decisions acknowledged: Abortion destroys what those decisions call “potential life” and what the law at issue in this case regards as the life of an “unborn human being.” See Roe, 410 U. S., at 159 (abortion is “inherently different”); Casey, 505 U. S., at 852 (abortion is “a unique act”). None of the other decisions cited by Roe and Casey involved the critical moral question posed by abortion. They are therefore inapposite. They do not support the right to obtain an abortion, and by the same token, our conclusion that the Constitution does not confer such a right does not undermine them in any way. 2 In drawing this critical distinction between the abortion right and other rights, it is not necessary to dispute Casey’s claim (which we accept for the sake of argument) that “the Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 33 Opinion of the Court specific practices of States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment” do not “mar[k] the outer limits of the substantive sphere of liberty which the Fourteenth Amendment protects.” 505 U. S., at 848. Abortion is nothing new. It has been addressed by lawmakers for centuries, and the fundamental moral question that it poses is ageless.  Defenders of Roe and Casey do not claim that any new scientific learning calls for a different answer to the underlying moral question, but they do contend that changes in society require the recognition of a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. Without the availability of abortion, they maintain, people will be inhibited from exercising their freedom to choose the types of relationships they desire, and women will be unable to compete with men in the workplace and in other endeavors. Americans who believe that abortion should be restricted press countervailing arguments about modern developments.

DETAILED SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

In the case of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court ruled that abortion was a fundamental right protected by the Constitution. In the subsequent case of Casey v. Planned Parenthood, the Court reaffirmed this ruling, but noted that the right to abortion was not absolute and that states could place restrictions on the procedure. Now, in the case of Gonzales v. Carhart, the Court is being asked to consider whether a federal law that bans so-called partial-birth abortions is constitutional. In its opinion, the Court first notes that Roe and Casey did not address the specific issue of partial-birth abortions, but that the fundamental right to abortion established in those cases applies to this procedure as well. The Court then turns to the question of whether the federal law at issue in this case is constitutional. The law in question bans a specific type of abortion procedure known as "partial-birth abortion." The Court first considers the arguments of those who support the law. They argue that partial-birth abortions are never medically necessary and that they are a particularly brutal and inhumane form of abortion. The Court then turns to the arguments of those who oppose the law. They argue that the law is too vague and that it could potentially ban all abortions, not just partial-birth abortions. The Court ultimately concludes that the law is constitutional. It finds that the law is not too vague and that it does not ban all abortions. The Court also finds that the law is not an undue burden on the right to abortion established in Roe and Casey.
