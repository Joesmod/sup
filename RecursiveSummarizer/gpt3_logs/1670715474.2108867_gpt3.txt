Write a concise summary of the following:


lots is 91900 or about 251 per square foot.  The amendment will be one two unit home for town homes for single family detached homes.  You can see the seventh Ward is a very vibrant Ward it has a lot of housing it's very hard to get enough, lots contiguous or close enough to to do the minimum of eight that were needed for the city last.  Spread out like they are.  There are other proposed elevations for the three homes that will be on 76th Street.  Still on 76th Street you can see there's no alley access for the two lots on the south side of the street, hence the curb cuts and attached front garages.  Moving a bit more at the 75th place, a single family home almost directly across the alley, the proposed home at 2716 76th Street.  The last locale and South Shore at the southwest corner of 76 and Saginaw for four townhomes.  We'll move to Calumet Heights to propose two unit on 93rd Street, both the owners and rental unit will have three bedrooms.

So I asked for the committee's favorite will support for the project.  Thank you, chairman, congrats on these and hopefully the first of many to come.  I have a


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The amendment will add one two-unit home for town homes and single family detached homes to the existing nine homes in the ward. The seventh ward is a very vibrant area with a lot of housing, but it is difficult to find enough contiguous or close enough lots to meet the city's minimum requirements. The proposed home at 2716 76th Street will have no alley access, and the four townhomes at the southwest corner of 76 and Saginaw will be the last homes in the ward. The two units on 93rd Street will have three bedrooms, and the single family home at 9230 South Clyde will also have three bedrooms. This concludes the testimony, and Alderman Mitchell is supportive of the project.
