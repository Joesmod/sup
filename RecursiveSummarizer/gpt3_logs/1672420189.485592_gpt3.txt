now, and then what that looks like either coming back or, or staying or, but that's part of the discussion that's going to happen over the next year.  Okay.  All right, very well.  I know that we also discussed the.  We talked about the Department of Environment, the streets and sanitation, also our task force order is related to overall sanitation collection.  Where, where we on that particular front.  I'm sorry Mr.  I'm sorry, I'll demand I missed your last part of your question.  Is in relation to more review of the collection efforts today versus where they been we've got a nice body of information now to, to talk to that and just trying to make those comparisons between a point one and point two.  This is around garbage or based.  Yes, yes.  So we have taken a look at that.  We're happy to definitely have more conversation around that about what the costs what would be to go back to word based versus what it is today.  And it is, it is a high dollar amount that we've pulled together.  Well, I you know I'm a believer that we don't necessarily have to have need necessarily need more resources to make that work but work within the confines of what we have to see, you know, if it is possible.  And I think that's part of the exercise that we may need to entail so again, thank you for your information back to us on on these things.  I may have another question I got to look at something on Madame chair you caught me off guard real quick but if you could come back to me I appreciate it after.  Maybe why they and I can agree on something else.  We'll see.  Alderman so lost the Garza.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Thank you, Susie for everything that you do you're such a hard worker.  So I have to piggyback off of my colleagues about this office of climate and environmental equity.  We need a department of environment.  Bottom line, and I'm going to address my questions to cheat the chief sustainability officer.  You are going to be running this office correct.  Thank you
