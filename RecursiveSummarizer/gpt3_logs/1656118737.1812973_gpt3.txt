scheme, each trimester of pregnancy was regulated differently, but the most critical line was drawn at roughly the end of the second trimester, which, at the time, corresponded to the point at which a fetus was thought to achieve “viability,” i.e., the ability to survive outside the womb. Although the Court acknowledged that States had a legitimate interest in protecting “potential life,”1 it found that this interest could not justify any restriction on previability abortions. The Court did not explain the basis for this line, and even abortion supporters have found it hard to defend Roe’s reasoning. One prominent constitutional scholar wrote that he “would vote for a statute very much like the one the Court end[ed] up drafting” if he were “a legislator,” but his assessment of Roe was memorable and brutal: Roe was “not constitutional law” at all and gave “almost no sense of an obligation to try to be.”2 At the time of Roe, 30 States still prohibited abortion at all stages. In the years prior to that decision, about a third of the States had liberalized their laws, but Roe abruptly ended that political process. It imposed the same highly restrictive regime on the entire Nation, and it effectively struck down the abortion laws of every single State.3 As —————— 1 Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, 163 (1973). 2 J.

Paradoxically, the judgment in Casey did a fair amount of overruling. Several important abortion decisions were —————— 4See R. Ginsburg, Speaking in a Judicial Voice, 67 N. Y. U. L.

DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

In Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court struck down state laws prohibiting abortion, ruling that a woman's right to an abortion is protected by the Constitution. In the years since Roe, the Court has revisited the issue several times, but has largely upheld the decision. In Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, the Court ruled that Roe's "central holding" - that a state may not constitutionally protect fetal life before "viability" - must be followed even if the decision was wrong. This ruling has been controversial, with many people arguing that it represents an exercise of raw judicial power.
