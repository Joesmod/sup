appropriate standard for such challenges, and that procuring an abortion is not a fundamental constitutional right. The Court finds that the legitimate interests of the state of Mississippi, including the preservation of prenatal life, the protection of maternal health and safety, and the prevention of discrimination, justify the state's Gestational Age Act. The Act prohibits abortion after fifteen weeks of pregnancy, except in cases of medical emergency or severe fetal abnormality.  In 1868, Missouri, Illinois, and New York had laws criminalizing abortion at all stages of pregnancy. These laws were designed to protect the life of the unborn and to prevent the barbaric practice of dilation and evacuation abortions. The Supreme Court has now overturned Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood, returning the authority to regulate or prohibit abortion to the people and their elected representatives.  In 1827, Illinois became the first state to criminalize abortion. The law made it a misdemeanor to administer any medicine, drug, substance, or use any instrument with the intent to destroy a child in the womb, unless it was necessary to preserve the life of the mother or advised by two physicians. The punishment for violators was up to one year in jail and/or a fine of up to $500. In 1833, the law was amended to extend liability to abortions procured by any means and to increase the penalties to imprisonment of up to two to ten years. In 1834, Ohio enacted a similar law, criminalizing abortion and prescribing a punishment of up to one year in jail and/or a fine of up to $500. Indiana followed suit in 1835, with a law that made it a misdemeanor to administer any medicine, drug, substance, or use any instrument with the intent to procure a miscarriage, unless it was necessary to preserve the life of the mother or advised by two physicians. The punishment for violators was up to one year in jail and/or a fine of up to $500.  1. The Dobbs case is about a woman who was pregnant and wanted to have an abortion. 2.
