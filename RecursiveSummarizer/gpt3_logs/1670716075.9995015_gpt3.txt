PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


Commissioner Chicago Department of Public Health morning.  Good morning.  No, we have received $0 for MPV response that's because Congress is not allocated funding toward MPV.  We've done everything that we can to work our MPV response into other responses so for example, when we are out doing MPV vaccines we also offer COVID vaccines which is a way to tie that together.  No, we have not received and I honestly don't anticipate receiving dedicated MPV funding from the federal government.  Well Commissioner you know, especially in minority communities, we're not, we're not reaching the people that were the, where the where this epidemic is going.  I'm just, you know, with with these kind of grants I just surprised that I know what you're doing in terms of trying to merge them and getting people, whether COVID or whatever but if any federal funding becomes available we will of course apply for it and we have been lifting up as have local health departments and state health departments across this country.  I think it's to the larger point that as a country, we like to fund public health by disease, and only after an outbreak has started, and I'm really pushing to try to instead have our funding support the core capabilities that we need to respond to any disease outbreak, but.  Yeah, so, through the chair.  I would like to know if you've segregated funding for MPV.  How much has been spent.  Yeah, we have not segregated any funding from PV because we have not received any funding for MPV are all of our funding for infectious diseases comes through specific disease lines so we have worked MPV response into all of our other funding lines and braided together funding to be able to you don't have the truth chair you don't have a real dollar amount that has been allocated so to speak for MPV know all of our MPV work has really been in kind and tied to other, other diseases and that's similar for most other outbreaks that we work on.  Thank you.  Thank you chair.  Thank
