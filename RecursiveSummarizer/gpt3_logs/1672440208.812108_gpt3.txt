unsuccessful motion to reconsider with the exception of Alderman Dow voting now.  With the objection and exception noted, I hear no further objections so ordered.  Thank you, Madam President.  All right, ladies and gentlemen, moving back to item number two.  Vegas back if I may, I just want to say congratulations to the far south side.  It's a long, long, long time.  It's absolutely needed.  It gives us the opportunity to take advantage of historic federal dollars.  I want to say thank you to the Biden administration for recognizing that there are these big mega projects that need federal funding.  And this is one of the things that we need this is one of them.  And I look forward to ribbon cutting, groundbreaking, whatever comes next.  But I also want to say a special thank you and shout out to the folks in Alcott Gardens who have been disconnected and cut off as Alderman Abil has said for far too long.  Thank you.  All right, Madam President, moving to item number two or back to item two.  This is a communication recommending a proposed ordinance regarding the authority to enter into and execute an intergovernmental agreement with the Chicago Park District to provide tax increment financing funds for the construction of a park with the new Park District headquarters facility, a field house, multi-purpose community rooms, outdoor sport and play site amenities at 4800 Southwestern Avenue and the 14th ward and the amount of $10 million.  Unless there's someone that wishes to speak on this item, I move passage by the first most favorable roll call vote of the committee on finance report and corresponding unsuccessful motion to reconsider.  Hearing no objection, so ordered.  Madam President, item three is a communication recommending a proposed ordinance regarding the authority to enter into and execute a redevelopment agreement with Chicago Cooperative DBA Chicago Market, a community co-op lease tenant with Chicago Transit Authority for tax increment financing funds
