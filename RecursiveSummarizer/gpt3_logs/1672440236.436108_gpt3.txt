I did mention the fact that the land swap for the property on which the casino would eventually sit is the subject of a sale lease back transaction due to the fact that Balleys is under capitalized and it was pointed out after my comments yesterday the Balleys team responded.

They weren't running a casino at the time and they don't have experience in a major construction venture such as
