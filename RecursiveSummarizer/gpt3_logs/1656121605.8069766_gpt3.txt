CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

In 1883, Tennessee passed a law making it a crime to administer any substance or use any instrument with the intent to destroy a fetus, unless it was necessary to save the life of the mother. The law was amended in 1910 to make it a crime to administer any substance or use any instrument with the intent to cause a miscarriage, abortion, or premature labor, regardless of whether the mother's life was in danger. South Carolina passed a similar law in 1883.
