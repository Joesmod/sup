Isn't Justice -- JUSTICE KAGAN: Yeah, I -- CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank -- thank you, counsel. Justice Thomas, anything further? Heritage Reporting Corporation                           1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 80 Official - Subject to Final Review Justice Alito?  JUSTICE ALITO: Well, back to my black Santa example, suppose it's a state that defines  a public accomodation -- prohibits a public  accommodation to discriminate on the basis of  political ideology. So then -- then the picture  has to be taken?  MR. OLSON: I -- I think that is  likely -- those political ideology distinctions face much more difficult constitutional scrutiny and I think are separate in kind from the kind of characteristics that we're talking about here, which are categories of invidious discrimination. I can only think, in most circumstances, political ideology did not satisfy the constitutional requirements. JUSTICE ALITO: So it has to satisfy a constitutional requirement? Your argument is dependent on that? MR. OLSON: Yes, because even under O'Brien, there's -- there's -- we have to show a basis for what we're doing. JUSTICE ALITO: In light of what Justice Kennedy wrote in Obergefell about honorable people who object to same-sex Heritage Reporting Corporation                           1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 81 Official - Subject to Final Review marriage, do you think it's fair to equate  opposition to same-sex marriage with opposition  to interracial marriage?  MR. OLSON: Yes, because -- in how the law applies, not in -- in the -- the discussion with folks because, of course, honorable people have different views on this issue. But I think, when you look at what Justice Kennedy said there, the way to honor that requirement is, as this Court has set forth in Fulton, in Masterpiece, of having a rigorous interrogation to make sure that there are neutral and generally applicable laws applied in fact that way
