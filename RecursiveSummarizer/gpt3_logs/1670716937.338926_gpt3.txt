will help you? You tell me, you're the expert on your own experience, tell me what will help you.  And what they say is they wanna get paid, they need to get bonded, they need to get access to capital.  Some of the really smaller ones need help with things like figuring out how to do certified payroll compliance, taxes, one of the things I can say, I started out life as a construction lawyer 35 years ago.  And a lot of these firms don't read these contracts they signed and they could sure use some support that way.  So for example, the Missouri Department of Transportation had a supportive services program with reduced fees for construction lawyers and accountants.  I thought it was great because this is the type of support people need.  So if we get going now, we'll be in a better position to help these people to take advantage of the probably deluge of opportunities.  Cause we don't want what happened with ARPA, which is all this money got spent, but at the end of the day, we were, I think all disappointed with the numbers that went to minority firms.  So I think if we prepare now, we can be in pretty good shape.  Thank you, Ms.  Holton.  I look forward to working with my colleagues and looking into the outdated mandates that we have, especially with LGBTQ.  And I think that there's a lot of work to do, maybe some subgroups so we can talk directly to the contractors.  I think that's a great idea, Ms.  Holton.  Thank you very much for joining us.  Thank you.  Thank you, Audemars-Sainte-Lopez.  Appreciate your questions.  Next is Audemars-Dio Villegas.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  I just have one quick question.  Colette, have we looked at or have we considered when a MBE has subcontracting opportunities, not counting those dollars against their contractual gross receipts? So for example, if a MBE is a prime on a project and has a million dollar contract, however, 400,000 of it is going to be supplies or subcontract it out, couldn't we just count that $600,000
