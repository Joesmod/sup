RESPONSE:

The amount of the tax credit for qualified facilities that elect to use it will be replaced with the value of the credit multiplied by the applicable percentage. For qualified facilities that satisfy certain requirements, the applicable percentage will be 100 percent. For other qualified facilities, the applicable percentage will be phased down from 100 percent to 0 percent depending on when construction of the facility began. Exceptions may be made if the inclusion of domestically produced steel, iron, or manufactured products would increase the overall costs of construction by more than 25 percent or if relevant domestically produced products are not available in sufficient quantities or of a satisfactory quality.
