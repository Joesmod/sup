RESPONSE:

In the conversation, Justice Alito asks Mr. Olson if he thinks it would be honorable to discriminate on the basis of race, and Mr. Olson says no. Justice Alito then gives a hypothetical situation in which a person is forced to write vows or speeches that espouse things they loathe, and Mr. Olson says that they cannot be forced to do that because it's not a protected characteristic.
