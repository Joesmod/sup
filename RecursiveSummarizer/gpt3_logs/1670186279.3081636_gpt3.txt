Write a concise summary of the following:


rising uh producer costs manufacturing costs and labor costs um this would be in line when the emergency authorities only exercised but we're taking this from an emergency power making it a permanent one correct the the emergency authorities there it's only the threshold what the cpo has to exercise so right now it is a million dollars that the cpo is grant authority by city council for an emergency procurement for life safety public health city operations etc thank you and for the record prior to our emergency authorization what was the threshold five this 500,000 500,000 so um through the chair i'd like to know how many transactions the cpo is looking at that that range between 500,000 and a million i suspect lots i think the question is how many transactions across the city do we have in that's higher than 500,000 i concern is this this change takes members of the city council out of a whole lot of conversations and i'm certainly not looking to slow down the city and its procurement but this is a big giveaway when it comes to city council oversight so i'd like to understand the universe that you know the grand total of these decisions that are being made that we will no longer be a part of if we make permanent these emergency powers okay thank you uh and that that's uh one last question um i'm not even going to talk about the big salary increases um but on the short-term rental licensing and i don't want to get any further into it but just to be very clear these these um lower thresholds so the the platforms that list fewer units i saw one in the ordinance that goes down to like one unit to the nine um so maybe this is for commissioner uh meyer um are there pla there are platforms out there that only have one to nine short-term rentals is this someone like creating their own website um i mean i know that we wanted to capture vrbo and treat them like airbnb but i didn't know that there were tiny little platforms out there that would have one to nine units listed


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The city is looking to make a permanent change to the emergency procurement threshold, which would take power away from the city council and give it to the cpo. This would affect transactions that range between 500,000 and a million dollars. The city is also looking to make changes to the short-term rental licensing, which would lower the thresholds for platforms that list fewer units.
