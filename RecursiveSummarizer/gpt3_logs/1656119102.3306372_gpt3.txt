Write a detailed summary of the following:

means “of ample or considerable amount, quantity, or size.” Random House Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary 1897 (2d ed. 2001). Huge burdens are plainly “substantial,” and trivial ones are not, but in between these extremes, there is a wide gray area. This ambiguity is a problem, and the second rule, which applies at all stages of a pregnancy, muddies things further. It states that measures designed “to ensure that the woman’s choice is informed” are constitutional so long as they do not impose “an undue burden on the right.” Casey, 505 U. S., at 878. To the extent that this rule applies to previability abortions, it overlaps with the first rule and appears to impose a different standard. Consider a law that imposes an insubstantial obstacle but serves little purpose. As applied to a pre-viability abortion, would such a regulation be constitutional on the ground that it does not impose a “substantial obstacle”? Or would it be unconstitutional on  58 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court the ground that it creates an “undue burden” because the burden it imposes, though slight, outweighs its negligible benefits? Casey does not say, and this ambiguity would lead to confusion down the line. Compare June Medical, 591 U. S., at ___–___ (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 1–2), with id., at ___–___ (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring) (slip op., at 5– 6). The third rule complicates the picture even more. Under that rule, “[u]nnecessary health regulations that have the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion impose an undue burden on the right.” Casey, 505 U. S., at 878 (emphasis added). This rule contains no fewer than three vague terms. It includes the two already discussed—“undue burden” and “substantial obstacle”—even though they are inconsistent. And it adds a third ambiguous term when it refers to “unnecessary health regulations.” The term “necessary” has a range of meanings—from “essential” to merely “useful.” See Black’s Law Dictionary 928 (5th ed. 1979); American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 877 (1971). Casey did not explain the sense in which the term is used in this rule. In addition to these problems, one more applies to all three rules. They all call on courts to examine a law’s effect on women, but a regulation may have a very different impact on different women for a variety of reasons, including their places of residence, financial resources, family situations, work and personal obligations, knowledge about fetal development and abortion, psychological and emotional disposition and condition, and the firmness of their desire to obtain abortions. In order to determine whether a regulation presents a substantial obstacle to women, a court needs to know which set of women it should have in mind and how many of the women in this set must find that an obstacle is “substantial.” Casey provided no clear answer to these questions. It said that a regulation is

RESPONSE:

The Court in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization struck down three provisions of a Mississippi law regulating abortion, finding that they violated the "undue burden" standard set forth in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. The first provision required that all abortions be performed in a hospital after the first trimester. The second required that a woman seeking an abortion must receive counseling at least 24 hours before the procedure, and the third required that the counseling include information about the risks of abortion and the alternatives to abortion. The Court found that the first provision would impose a substantial burden on women seeking abortions, as it would require them to travel to a hospital and would likely increase the cost of the procedure. The second and third provisions, while not imposing a substantial burden, would nonetheless be unconstitutional because they would have the effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to women seeking abortions. The Court noted that the three provisions were part of a larger scheme of regulations that would make it difficult for women to obtain abortions in Mississippi, and that this scheme could not be upheld under the undue burden standard.
