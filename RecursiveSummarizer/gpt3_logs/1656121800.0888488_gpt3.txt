CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization strips women of agency over their bodies, overruling Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood in the process. This decision goes against the principle of stare decisis, which is central to the rule of law, and takes away a woman's liberty. The dissenters would uphold Roe and Casey, and keep women's reproductive rights intact.
