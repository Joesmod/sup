RESPONSE:

The Court's opinion in Roe v. Wade featured a lengthy survey of history, but much of its discussion was irrelevant, and the Court made no effort to explain why it was included. For example, multiple paragraphs were devoted to an account of the views and practices of ancient civilizations where infanticide was widely accepted. See 410 U. S., at 130132 (discussing ancient Greek and Roman practices).49 When it came to the most important historical fact—how the States regulated abortion when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted—the Court said almost nothing. It allowed that States had tightened their abortion laws in the middle and late 19th century, id., at 139, but it implied that these laws might have been enacted not to protect fetal life but to further a Victorian social concern about illicit sexual conduct, id., at 148. Roe's failure even to note the overwhelming consensus of state laws in effect in 1868 is striking, and what it said about the common law was simply wrong. Relying on two discredited articles by an abortion advocate, the Court erroneously suggested—contrary to Bracton, Coke, Hale, Blackstone, and a wealth of other authority—that the common law had probably never really treated post-quickening abortion as a crime. See id., at 136 ([I]t now appear[s] doubtful that abortion was ever firmly established as a common-law crime even with respect to the destruction of a quick fetus). This erroneous understanding appears to have played an important part in the Court's thinking because the opinion cited the lenity of the common law as one of the four factors that informed its decision. Id., at 165. After surveying history, the opinion spent many paragraphs conducting the sort of fact-finding that might be undertaken by a legislative committee. This included a lengthy account of the position of the American Medical Association and [t]he position of the American Public Health Association, as well as the vote by the American Bar Association's House of Delegates in February 1972 on proposed abortion legislation. Id., at 141, 144, 146 (emphasis deleted). Also noted were a British judicial decision handed down in 1939 and a new British abortion law enacted in 1967. Id., at 137138. The Court did not explain why these sources shed light on the meaning of the Constitution, and not one of them adopted or advocated anything like the scheme that Roe imposed on the country. Finally, after all this, the Court turned to precedent. Citing a broad array of cases, the Court found support for a right to privacy broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. Id., at 153154. The Court acknowledged that its conclusion was contrary to longstanding precedent holding that abortion is a criminal offense, but it explained that this precedent was erroneous and had been undermined by more recent decisions. Id., at 151152. In sum, the Court's opinion in Roe v. Wade was based on a survey of history that was largely irrelevant, on a misreading of precedent, and on an extensive review of contemporary medical and legal literature that did not support the Court's conclusions.
