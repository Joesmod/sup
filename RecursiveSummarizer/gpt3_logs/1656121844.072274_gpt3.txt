There was no escaping the need for Adkins to go. Brown v. Board of Education overruled Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537 (1896), along with its doctrine of separate but equal.

See, e.g., Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U. S. 629 (1950); Sipuel v. Board of Regents of Univ. of Okla., 332 U. S. 631 (1948) (per curiam); Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada, 305 U. S. 337 (1938).

The majority says that in recognizing those changes, we are implicitly supporting the half-century interlude between Plessy and Brown. See ante, at 70. That is not so. First, if the Brown Court had used the majoritys method of constitutional construction, it might not ever have overruled Plessy, whether 5 or 50 or 500 years later.

But even setting that aside, we are not saying that a decision can never be overruled just because it is terribly wrong. Take West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U.

It happened as well because individual Justices changed their minds, not because a new majority wanted to undo the decisions of their predecessors. Both Barnette and Brown, moreover, share another feature setting them apart from the Courts ruling today. They protected individual   46 DOBBS v.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court overruled Plessy v. Ferguson, which had allowed for "separate but equal" public facilities for black and white citizens. The Court held that this policy was unconstitutional, as it violated the Reconstruction Amendments guaranteeing full citizenship for former slaves. The Court also noted that segregation could never be consistent with the Amendments, and that it had detrimental effects on children's hearts and minds.
