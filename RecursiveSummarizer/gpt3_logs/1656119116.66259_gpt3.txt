DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The author begins by discussing the "unworkable" nature of the "undue burden" test established by the Supreme Court in the case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey. The author argues that this test has led to the distortion of many important legal doctrines, and that it is time for the Court to reconsider its stance on abortion. The author goes on to discuss how the Court's abortion cases have undermined other areas of law, including the strict standard for facial constitutional challenges, the third-party standing doctrine, and the principles of res judicata. The author concludes by arguing that the Supreme Court should reconsider its position on abortion in light of the many problems that have arisen as a result of its current stance.
