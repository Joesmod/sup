what where I will do that.  Thank you.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  Thank you, all the vice chair Burnett.  Thank you Mr Chairman.  So we're very excited about this.  Tim is actually a resident of the 27th Ward and the new West Side.  He's a pioneer in the community.  He, I appreciate.  This is a mission for him, a ministry for him actually to be doing this.  The houses still are, you know, the price point is still a little high.  And so that's why when you all have noticed that I spoke to the Department of Housing during the committee hearings about getting some of the sterling bays ARO money that they committed to give to my ward and I want to go to this.  I want to bring these prices down in the tools, so they can be a lot more affordable.  I have a commitment for ARO money to come to my ward, and I like for them to go to these houses and I like for him to be able to build more.  Tim actually has a lot of group, most of the people that work in his factory are from the West Side.  There's a lot of people from the community and teach them how to do these things and get into the construction industry.  So we're very excited about this.  This is actually going to help change the face of the West Side.  I have two goals, Harry, before I can catch up with you.  One is to fill in all my lots on the West Side, and the other is to finish Cabrini Green, right so Tim has helped me to fill in a lot on the West Side.  The other thing I got to do is finish my CHA housing in Cabrini Green.  Then I'll be coming on the ship and playing golf with you, Harry.  I believe you can do it Walter I mean you are leading the city of Chicago and building units, you've got more units in your ward, whatever version of your ward for the last 20 years and I think all the other wards combined so I think that this project, the people that are building these homes, the people that are going to be using these homes.  It is going to be dynamic and I think in a positive way with a lot of other
