Oh, we'll have to get back to you on that if anyone who has such a conviction is actually having a contract with the city, I'm not sure if it would apply retroactively or not, but we can look at that.  Chairman, yeah, thank you chairman I appreciate that we thought about that is to so ultimate Taylor, the current contracts that our existence would not be applicable but once they once they ended, they would be prohibited from participating further.
