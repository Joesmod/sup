factor for transportation fuels. The emissions factor is the amount of CO2e emitted per mmBTU of fuel. The emissions rate for each fuel is established by the Secretary and published in a table annually.  This section establishes the emissions rates for transportation fuels, expressed in terms of kilograms of CO2e per mmBTU. The rates are to be based on the most recent determinations under the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation model developed by Argonne National Laboratory, or a successor model. For aviation fuels, the rates are to be based on the most recent Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization with the agreement of the United States, or a similar methodology. The rates may be rounded to the nearest multiple of 5 kilograms of CO2e per mmBTU, except in the case of an emissions rate that is between 2.5 and -2.5 kilograms of CO2e per mmBTU, which may be rounded to zero.  A taxpayer producing fuel for transportation may file a petition with the Secretary for determination of the emissions rate with respect to such fuel. The emissions rate will be adjusted for inflation starting in 2024.  This section deals with the clean fuel production credit, which is a credit that is available for producing transportation fuels with low emissions. The credit is available for monoglycerides, diglycerides, triglycerides, free fatty acids, and fatty acid esters.  The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 created a tax credit for the production of clean fuel. To be eligible for the credit, the taxpayer must be registered as a producer of clean fuel at the time of production and must provide certification from an unrelated party demonstrating compliance with requirements similar to those established under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation. The fuel must also be produced in the United States.  The section amends the Internal Revenue Code to

This section of the code establishes the emissions rates for transportation fuels, expressed in terms of kilograms of CO2e per mmBTU. The rates are to be based on the most recent determinations under the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation model developed by Argonne National Laboratory, or a successor model. For aviation fuels, the rates are to be based on the most recent Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization with the agreement of the United States, or a similar methodology. The rates may be rounded to the nearest multiple of 5 kilograms of CO2e per mmBTU, except in the case of an emissions rate that is between 2.5 and -2.5 kilograms of CO2e per mmBTU, which may be rounded to zero. A taxpayer producing fuel for transportation may file a petition with the Secretary for determination of the emissions rate with respect to such fuel. The emissions rate will be adjusted for inflation starting in 2024.
