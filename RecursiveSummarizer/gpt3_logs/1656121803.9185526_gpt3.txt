Write a concise summary of the following:

decision, even a constitutional one, without a special justification. Gamble v. United States, 587 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 11). Stare decisis is, of course, not an inexorable command; it is sometimes appropriate to overrule an earlier decision. Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 233 (2009). But the Court must have a good reason to do so over and above the belief that the precedent was wrongly decided. Halliburton Co. v. Erica P. John Fund, Inc., 573 U. S. 258, 266 (2014). [I]t is not alone sufficient that we would decide a case differently now than we did then. Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC, 576 U. S. 446, 455 (2015). The majority today lists some 30 of our cases as overruling precedent, and argues that they support overruling Roe and Casey. But none does, as further described below and in the Appendix. See infra, at 6166. In some, the Court only partially modified or clarified a precedent. And in the rest, the Court relied on one or more of the traditional stare decisis factors in reaching its conclusion. The Court found, for example, (1) a change in legal doctrine that undermined or made obsolete the earlier decision; (2) a factual change that had the same effect; or (3) an absence of reliance because the earlier decision was less than a decade old. (The majority is wrong when it says that we insist on a test of changed law or fact alone, although that is present in most of the cases. See ante, at 69.) None of those factors apply here: Nothingand in particular, no significant legal or factual changesupports overturning a half-century of settled law giving women control over their reproductive lives. First, for all the reasons we have given, Roe and Casey were correct. In holding that a State could not resolve the debate about abortion in such a definitive way that a woman lacks all choice in the matter, the Court protected womens liberty and womens equality in a way comporting with our Fourteenth Amendment precedents. Casey, 505  32 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting U. S., at 850. Contrary to the majoritys view, the legal status of abortion in the 19th century does not weaken those decisions. And the majoritys repeated refrain about usurp[ing] state legislatures power to address a publicly contested question does not help it on the key issue here. Ante, at 44; see ante, at 1. To repeat: The point of a right is to shield individual actions and decisions from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts. Barnette, 319 U. S., at 638; supra, at 7. However divisive, a right is not at the peoples mercy. In any event [w]hether or not we . . . agree with a prior precedent is the beginning, not the end, of our analysis and the remaining principles of stare decisis weigh heavily against overruling Roe and Casey.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Court must have a good reason to overrule an earlier decision, and the majority today does not have a good reason to overrule Roe and Casey. The point of a right is to shield individual actions and decisions from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts.
