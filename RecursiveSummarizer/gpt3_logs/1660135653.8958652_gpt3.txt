RESPONSE:

The Energy Policy and Conservation Act provides funding for grants to assist States and units of local government in adopting and implementing building energy codes. The codes must meet or exceed the 2021 International Energy Conservation Code for residential buildings, the ANSI/ASHRAE/IES Standard 90.12019 for commercial buildings, or achieve equivalent or greater energy savings. The codes must also meet the zero energy provisions in the 2021 International Energy Conservation Code for both residential and commercial buildings. The plan for full compliance with the code must include active training and enforcement programs, as well as measurement of the rate of compliance each year.
