DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The U.S. Supreme Court has overruled important constitutional decisions on many occasions, most recently in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), which recognized the right to same-sex marriage. Other notable examples include Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm'n (2010), which protected campaign-related speech, and Lawrence v. Texas (2003), which protected the right to engage in consensual, same-sex intimacy in one's home. In each of these cases, the Court reversed course on an earlier decision that had been widely criticized as being seriously wrong. In Barnette (1943), the Court only reversed itself three years after its initial decision in Minersville School Dist. v. Gobitis (1940), which had upheld a law requiring public school students to salute the flag. The Court has also overruled important constitutional decisions on more than one occasion. In Agostini v. Felton (1997), the Court reversed two of its own earlier decisions, Aguilar v. Felton (1985) and School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball (1985), which had limited the government's ability to provide aid to religious organizations. payne The U.S. Supreme Court has overruled important constitutional decisions on many occasions, most recently in Obergefell v.
