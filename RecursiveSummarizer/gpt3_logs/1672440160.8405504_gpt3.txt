potential of downtown and the near south side is being used to finance investment in historically disinvested areas.  This is a good use of TIF.  The Red Line extension carries tremendous potential when coupled with other city incentives and programs.  The city's new connected communities ordinance passed in 2022, which deepens incentives for development near transit, provides new opportunities to build housing, retail, and walkable, accessible, thriving streetscapes along this corridor.  That potential is magnified as the city leverages other programs like Invest Southwest to create vibrant, equitable, transit-oriented development around these new Red Line extension stations.  We thank you for your consideration of this major opportunity for Chicago's south side.  Metropolitan Planning Council, Active Transportation Alliance, and Center for Neighborhood Technology urge your yes vote for the Red Line extension.  Thank you.  Thank you Mr.  Williams for your comments.  Your honor, there are no other speakers who have timely signed up for the public comment period.  All right, this ends our public comment period.  We now have several resolutions, ladies and gentlemen.  Actually, before we get to that, the chair recognizes Chairman Harris.  Madam President, I move for the temporary suspension of the rules for the immediate consideration of the Rules Committee report, including the recommendation of the appointment of a new alderman for the 12th Ward and associated resolution establishing her committee membership and other items.  Madam President and members of the City Council, reporting for your committee and committees on rules which met yesterday, December 13, 2022, the committee recommends passage of the appointment of Annabelle Abarca as the 12th Ward alderman.  Chairman Harris, if you could just pause for a moment while we get everybody aligned.  Okay.  Ladies and gentlemen, the City Council of Standard Ease for three minutes.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.
