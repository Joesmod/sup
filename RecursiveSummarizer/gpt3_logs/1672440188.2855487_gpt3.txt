ward and I know the SROs are well-loved over there.  So great job to both of you.  Best of wishes to O'Marian, overcome into tragedy.  I can't imagine, can't imagine would like to lose a couple of siblings.  So young, so much life ahead of them.  Just all look forward.  We're all rooting for you, John and Kathy, somehow, some way, I believe this is not going to be the last time you're going to be here.  So hopefully you get to stay at former for a while.

And then, which I've never heard of before, helped him apply for school and then made sure not only that he got to school by driving him there, but made sure that he had the resources that he needed to be successful.  That's a remarkable story.  And too often, as you've heard from members of this body, our officers are vilified.  They're painted with one broad brush.  But I know, and
