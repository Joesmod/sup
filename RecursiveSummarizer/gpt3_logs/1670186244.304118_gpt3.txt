five million dollars from Cook County and the city of Chicago in order for the CTA to receive RTA funds.  The city provides three million of the five million annual requirement while Cook County provides the two million.  This is an annual allocation provided by the city.  Is there a motion to recommend approval of item number nine on the agenda.  So so moved by Alderman Wagesback.  All those in favor signify by saying aye.  All those opposed.  Here we'll call for a roll call.  We will take the roll.  Point of information Alderman Tunney.

Yes this is not the one we want to throw the gauntlet down on because it is required by the Regional Transportation Act.  Alderman Harrison followed by Alderman Villegas.  Thank you Madam Chair.  I think the issue is the fact that we've got a letter from the president of CTA saying that he's going to appear on November 10th and people have been asking for him to appear for several months and so we're going to pass this and and I understand that we have an obligation to do so but at the same token he has an obligation to appear before this body which he has been reluctant to do.  Thank you Alderman Harrison.  Alderman Villegas.  Thank you Madam Chair.  Is there any reporting back from CTA as to the how they're going to utilize these funds? That's my only question.  This is the match that we provide the five million that you know under the RTA Act that we are required to do.  We do not have reporting back.  It is a small piece to the to the larger match.  Alderman Cardenas.  Thank you Madam Chair.  I was one of those proponents in fact I was going to vote no on this if there was not a commitment from
