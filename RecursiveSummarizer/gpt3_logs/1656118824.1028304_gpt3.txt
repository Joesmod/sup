constitutional scrutiny unless the regulation is a “mere pretex[t] designed to effect an invidious discrimination against members of one sex or the other.” Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 U. S. 484, 496, n. 20 (1974). And as the Court has stated, the “goal of preventing abortion” does not constitute “invidiously discriminatory animus” against women. Bray v. Alexandria Women’s Health Clinic, 506 U. S. 263, 273–274 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, laws regulating or prohibiting abortion are not subject to heightened scrutiny. Rather, they are governed by the same standard of review as other health and safety measures.18 With this new theory addressed, we turn to Casey’s bold assertion that the abortion right is an aspect of the “liberty” protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 505 U. S., at 846; Brief for Respondents 17; Brief for United States 21–22. 2 The underlying theory on which this argument rests— that the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause provides substantive, as well as procedural, protection for “liberty”—has long been controversial. But our decisions have held that the Due Process Clause protects two categories of substantive rights. The first consists of rights guaranteed by the first eight Amendments. Those Amendments originally applied only to the Federal Government, Barron ex rel. Tiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243, 247–251 (1833) (opinion for the Court by Marshall, C. J.), but this Court has held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment “incorporates” the great majority of those rights and thus makes them equally applicable to the States. See McDonald, 561 —————— 18We discuss this standard in Part VI of this opinion.   12 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court U. S., at 763–767, and nn. 12–13. The second category— which is the one in question here—comprises a select list of fundamental rights that are not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution. In deciding whether a right falls into either of these categories, the Court has long asked whether the right is “deeply rooted in [our] history and tradition” and whether it is essential to our Nation’s “scheme of ordered liberty.” Timbs v. Indiana, 586 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 3) (internal quotation marks omitted); McDonald, 561 U. S., at 764, 767 (internal quotation marks omitted); Glucksberg, 521 U.

Justice Ginsburg’s opinion for the Court in Timbs is a recent example. In concluding that the Eighth Amendment’s protection against excessive fines is “fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty” and “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition,” 586 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7) (internal quotation marks omitted), her opinion traced the right back to Magna Carta, Blackstone’s Commentaries, and 35 of the 37 state

RESPONSE:

In the United States, the Supreme Court has long held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects two categories of substantive rights. The first consists of rights guaranteed by the first eight Amendments. Those Amendments originally applied only to the Federal Government, but this Court has held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment “incorporates” the great majority of those rights and thus makes them equally applicable to the States. The second category— which is the one in question here—comprises a select list of fundamental rights that are not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution. In deciding whether a right falls into either of these categories, the Court has long asked whether the right is “deeply rooted in [our] history and tradition” and whether it is essential to our Nation’s “scheme of ordered liberty.” And in conducting this inquiry, we have engaged in a careful analysis of the history of the right at issue. Justice Ginsburg’s opinion for the Court in Timbs is a recent example. In concluding that the Eighth Amendment’s protection against excessive fines is “fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty” and “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition,” her opinion traced the right back to Magna Carta, Blackstone’s Commentaries, and 35 of the 37 state constitutions. A similar analysis is necessary here. The right in question is the right to abortion. The question before the Court is whether this right is “fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty” and “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition.” In order to answer this question, we must first examine the history of abortion. Abortion has been practiced throughout history, dating back to ancient times. It was not until the 19th century, however, that abortion began to be regulated. In 1821, Connecticut became the first State to enact a law criminalizing abortion. This law, and the others that followed, were motivated by a desire to protect women’s health and safety, as well as by a belief that abortion was morally wrong. The first half of the 20th century saw a gradual liberalization of abortion laws in the United States. By the mid-1960s, nearly half of the States had liberalized their laws to some extent. In 1973, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Roe v. Wade, which recognized a woman’s right to abortion. The Court’s decision was based on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Since Roe was decided, there has been a continued effort to overturn it or to limit its scope. In 1992, the Court issued its decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which reaffirmed the basic holding of Roe. The Court in Casey, however, did abandon the “strict scrutiny” standard of review that had been used in Roe. Instead, the Court adopted a more permissive standard, which has allowed for a number of restrictions on abortion to be enacted in the years since. The question before the Court now is whether the right to abortion is “fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty” and “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition.” In order to answer this question, we must examine the history of abortion.
