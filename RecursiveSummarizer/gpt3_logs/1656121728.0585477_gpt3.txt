Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 9 BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting over, enforced the constitutional principles Roe had declared. See, e.g., Ohio v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, 497 U. S. 502 (1990); Hodgson v. Minnesota, 497 U. S. 417 (1990); Simopoulos v. Virginia, 462 U. S. 506 (1983); Planned Parenthood Assn. of Kansas City, Mo., Inc. v. Ashcroft, 462 U. S. 476 (1983); H. L. v. Matheson, 450 U. S. 398 (1981); Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U. S. 622 (1979); Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52 (1976).  Then, in Casey, the Court considered the matter anew, and again upheld Roes core precepts. Casey is in significant measure a precedent about the doctrine of precedent until today, one of the Courts most important. But we leave for later that aspect of the Courts decision. The key thing now is the substantive aspect of the Courts considered conclusion that the essential holding of Roe v. Wade should be retained and once again reaffirmed. 505 U. S., at 846. Central to that conclusion was a full-throated restatement of a womans right to choose. Like Roe, Casey grounded that right in the Fourteenth Amendments guarantee of liberty. That guarantee encompasses realms of conduct not specifically referenced in the Constitution: Marriage is mentioned nowhere in that document, yet the Court was no doubt correct to protect the freedom to marry against state interference. 505 U. S., at 847848. And the guarantee of liberty encompasses conduct today that was not protected at the time of the Fourteenth Amendment. See id., at 848. It is settled now, the Court saidthough it was not always sothat the Constitution places limits on a States right to interfere with a persons most basic decisions about family and parenthood, as well as bodily integrity. Id., at 849 (citations omitted); see id., at 851 (similarly describing the constitutional protection given to personal decisions relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, [and] family relationships). Especially   10 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting important in this web of precedents protecting an individuals most personal choices were those guaranteeing the right to contraception. Ibid.; see id., at 852853. In those cases, the Court had recognized the right of the individual to make the vastly consequential decision whether to bear a child. Id., at 851 (emphasis deleted). So too, Casey reasoned, the liberty clause protects the decision of a woman confronting an unplanned pregnancy. Her decision about abortion was central, in the same way, to her capacity to chart her lifes course. See id., at 853. In reaffirming the right Roe recognized, the Court took full account of the diversity of views on abortion, and the importance of various competing state interests. Some Americans, the Court stated, deem [abortion] nothing short of an act of violence against innocent human life. 505 U.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court in Casey v. Planned Parenthood reaffirmed the right to abortion declared in Roe v. Wade. The Court reasoned that the right to abortion is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of liberty, which encompasses "conduct today that was not protected at the time of the Fourteenth Amendment." The Court took into account the diversity of views on abortion and the importance of various competing state interests, but ultimately concluded that the right to abortion must be upheld.
