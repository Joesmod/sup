called a special city council meeting to host a hearing on this resolution.  The subject matter hearing was a necessary step to get our resolution on the ballot.  The hearing fell one person short of having a quorum.  We are very disappointed by this lack of action on the part of the mayor and the city council to show up to this meeting and even give an opportunity for discussion on the important bring Chicago home ordinance.  Today, the bring Chicago home coalition and our allied Alders are reintroducing the bring Chicago home resolution.  We remain committed to fighting for this important measure to provide a dedicated revenue stream to fund housing and wraparound services for the 65,000 Chicagoans currently experiencing homelessness.  The who are homeless.  It is not enough for the City Council and the mayor to acknowledge this problem.  We need their action and so we call on our elders and our mayor to sign on to this ordinance and meet with us on this important issue.  Thank you.  Thank you Ms.  Stein for your comments.  Our next speaker is Melvin Bailey.  Good morning City Council.  Good morning.  It's been a while since- good morning Mayor.  Been a while since I spoke to you guys.  I want you to do one thing for me.  Google CAN TV and you'll see how many times I came down here under previous administration asking for opportunity but I must tell the truth.  This mayor and the Housing Department heard that.  This mayor and this Housing Department heard because now we are breaking ground to build affordable housing started in Alderman's Urban's Ward and Alderman Walter Burnett's Ward and I'd like to thank the mayor and please Google and you will hear my conversation have not changed since the last administration.  Mayor Day's administration, Ron administration, we need to get the guns out of these kids hands with opportunity in a job.  So thank God that the mayor and the Housing Department Miss- Commissioner Navarro and Will Edwards and I had them on the phone
