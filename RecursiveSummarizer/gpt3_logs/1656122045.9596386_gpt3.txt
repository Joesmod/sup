procreation, contraception, family relationships, and child rearing and education. For the same reasons, the Court held, the Constitution must protect a womans decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. The Court recognized the valid interests of the State in regulating the abortion decision, but struck a balance in favor of the woman's choice. In the 20 years between Roe and Casey, the Court expressly reaffirmed Roe on two occasions, and applied it on many more.  The Supreme Court in Casey v. Planned Parenthood reaffirmed the right to abortion declared in Roe v. Wade. The Court reasoned that the right to abortion is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of liberty, which encompasses "conduct today that was not protected at the time of the Fourteenth Amendment." The Court took into account the diversity of views on abortion and the importance of various competing state interests, but ultimately concluded that the right to abortion must be upheld.  The Court in Roe v. Wade held that the state has an interest in protecting potential life, but cannot force a woman to carry a child to term when she would have chosen an early abortion. In Casey v. Planned Parenthood, the Court held that the state has a significant interest in disallowing abortions after viability, but still cannot place an undue burden on a woman seeking an abortion prior to viability.  The majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization scoffs at the idea of balancing interests, castigating the dissent for repeatedly praising the balance the two cases arrived at. The majority would allow States to ban abortion from conception onward because it does not think forced childbirth at all implicates a woman's rights to equality and freedom. The dissenters argue that the liberty interests underlying the right to an abortion are quite similar to the liberty interests underlying the rights to contraception and same-sex marriage, and that the majority's failure to understand this fairly obvious point stems from its rejection of the idea of balancing interests in this (or maybe in any) constitutional context.  The Supreme Court has ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment does not provide a right to abortion. The majority opinion refers to some later and earlier history, but finds that this does not support abortion rights. Early law actually provides some support for abortion rights, but the majority offers no evidence to the contrary. The majority's core legal postulate is that we in the 21st century must read the Fourteenth Amendment just as its ratifiers did.  The majority opinion in the abortion case Roe v. Wade is based on a misinterpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment, according to the dissent. The amendment was ratified by men, who at the time did not view women as equals. The dissent argues that the Constitution has evolved since then to protect all individuals, regardless of gender, from abuse or unjustified interference by the government.  The U.S.
