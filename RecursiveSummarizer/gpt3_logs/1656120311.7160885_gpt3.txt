RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court has been criticized in recent years for its continued reliance on dubious scholarship when it comes to the issue of abortion. In particular, the Court has been criticized for its reliance on the work of Cyril Means, Jr., whose work on the history of abortion has been shown to be deeply flawed. Means' work is characterized by an internal memorandum as donning "the guise of impartial scholarship while advancing the proper ideological goals." This means that his work cannot be trusted as an accurate portrayal of history. The Solicitor General has suggested that history supports an abortion right because the common law's failure to criminalize abortion before quickening means that "at the Founding and for decades thereafter, women generally could terminate a pregnancy, at least in its early stages, without criminal liability." However, this argument is based on Means' work, which is not reliable. Respondents and their amici have no persuasive answer to this historical evidence. They are unable to show that a constitutional right to abortion was established when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted. Instead, they are forced to argue that it "does not matter" that some states prohibited abortion at the time Roe was decided. But this argument flies in the face of the standard the Supreme Court has applied in determining whether an asserted right that is nowhere mentioned in the Constitution is nevertheless protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.
