S., at 852. And each State has an interest in the protection of potential lifeas Roe itself had recognized. 505 U. S., at 871 (plurality opinion). On the one hand, that interest was not conclusive. The State could not resolve the moral and spiritual questions raised by abortion in such a definitive way that a woman lacks all choice in the matter. Id., at 850 (majority opinion). It could not force her to bear the pain and physical constraints of carr[ying] a child to full term when she would have chosen an early abortion. Id., at 852. But on the other hand, the State had, as Roe had held, an exceptionally significant interest in disallowing abortions in the later phase of a pregnancy. And it had an ever-present interest in ensur[ing] that the womans choice is informed and in presenting the case for choos[ing] childbirth over abortion. 505 U. S., at 878 (plurality opinion). So Casey again struck a balance, differing from Roes in only incremental ways. It retained Roes central holding that the State could bar abortion only after viability. 505 U. S., at 860 (majority opinion). The viability line, Casey thought, was more workable than any other in marking  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 11 BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting the place where the womans liberty interest gave way to a States efforts to preserve potential life. Id., at 870 (plurality opinion). At that point, a second life was capable of independent existence. Ibid. If the woman even by then had not acted, she lacked adequate grounds to object to the States intervention on [the developing childs] behalf. Ibid. At the same time, Casey decided, based on two decades of experience, that the Roe framework did not give States sufficient ability to regulate abortion prior to viability. In that period, Casey now made clear, the State could regulate not only to protect the womans health but also to promot[e] prenatal life. 505 U. S., at 873 (plurality opinion). In particular, the State could ensure informed choice and could try to promote childbirth. See id., at 877878. But the State still could not place an undue burdenor substantial obstaclein the path of a woman seeking an abortion. Id., at 878. Prior to viability, the woman, consistent with the constitutional meaning of liberty, must retain the ultimate control over her destiny and her body. Id., at 869. We make one initial point about this analysis in light of the majoritys insistence that Roe and Casey, and we in defending them, are dismissive of a States interest in protecting prenatal life. Ante, at 38. Nothing could get those decisions more wrong. As just described, Roe and Casey invoked powerful state interests in that protection, operative at every stage of the pregnancy and overriding the womans liberty after viability. The strength of those state interests is exactly why the Court allowed greater restrictions on the abortion right than on other rights deriving from the

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Court in Roe v. Wade held that the state has an interest in protecting potential life, but cannot force a woman to carry a child to term when she would have chosen an early abortion. In Casey v. Planned Parenthood, the Court held that the state has a significant interest in disallowing abortions after viability, but still cannot place an undue burden on a woman seeking an abortion prior to viability.
