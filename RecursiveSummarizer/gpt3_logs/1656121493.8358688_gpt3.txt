Opinion of the Court not enjoyed by an identical fetus in a remote area of a poor country? In addition, as the Court once explained, viability is not really a hard-and-fast line. Ibid. A physician determining a particular fetuss odds of surviving outside the womb must consider a number of variables, including gestational age, fetal weight, a womans general health and nutrition, the quality of the available medical facilities, and other factors. Id., at 395396. It is thus only with difficulty that a physician can estimate the probability of a particular fetuss survival. Id., at 396. And even if each fetuss probability of survival could be ascertained with certainty, settling on a probabilit[y] of survival that should count as viability is another matter. Ibid. Is a fetus viable with a 10 percent chance of survival? 25 percent? 50 percent? Can such a judgment be made by a State? And can a State specify a gestational age limit that applies in all cases? Or must these difficult questions be left entirely to the individual attending physician on the particular facts of the case before him? Id., at 388. The viability line, which Casey termed Roes central rule, makes no sense, and it is telling that other countries almost uniformly eschew such a line.52 The Court thus asserted raw judicial power to impose, as a matter of constitutional law, a uniform viability rule that allowed the States less freedom to regulate abortion than the majority of western democracies enjoy. d All in all, Roes reasoning was exceedingly weak, and academic commentators, including those who agreed with the  52According to the Center for Reproductive Rights, only the United States and the Netherlands use viability as a gestational limit on the availability of abortion on-request.

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court's opinion in Roe v. Wade is widely criticized by academic commentators for its lack of reasoning and its imposition of a uniform viability rule that limits the freedom of states to regulate abortion.
