Write a concise summary of the following:


I'm not clear as a why in a $16 billion budget.  We have to rely on a pro bono study, or just planning for something where, again, in this kind of budget with a $16 billion budget.  We don't see how we cannot have a fully funded study community effects study, as well as an amendment that was promised already where we're just talking about planning so I want to reiterate a question because I don't.  I don't see that and the answer to what's provided is not satisfactory to us around the study for the environment, both and also you know the amendment for the Chicago church or amendment because you talk about planning, you talk about a pro bono study.  How in a $16 billion budget we cannot have a fully funded for both of them.  So I will talk about the, the justice project that we do have funding to start with the planning, that is not to say that once the planning is completed when we have a better idea of what the broader cost is that that is part of that conversation.  I think that's the first step and there is funding for for that piece of it, so that we get an idea of what the full cost is, and then we can have that conversation.  In terms of the study.  You know, I will ask Angela maybe to chime in but you know I think what I will say is that I think there's a lot of interest in in, you know, us, and what this robust Department of Environment will look like and so you know, I think that's where we are starting with that pro bono assistance.  And then can you please repeat your question.  So my question is in a $16 billion budget, right and I think I'm good to see at least some movement on funding positions for to address or regulate against the environmental and justices that we see, but in a $16 billion budget, we are relying on a pro bono study, I'm not clear with that.  Because as you know, for us the community of impact study is going to be critical as we review future permits, and again, we will not allow more polluters to come in and dump all sorts of toxics
