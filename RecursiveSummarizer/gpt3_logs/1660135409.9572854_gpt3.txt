CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 establishes tax credits for investments in certain energy storage technologies and facilities. The credit is 6 percent for technologies with a capacity of less than 1 megawatt, and 30 percent for technologies that meet certain requirements. The credit is increased by the applicable credit rate increase for investments in qualified facilities or energy storage technologies within an energy community.
