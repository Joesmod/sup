PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:

THOMASs concurrencewhich makes clear he is not with the program. In saying that nothing in todays opinion casts doubt on non-abortion precedents, JUSTICE THOMAS explains, he means only that they are not at issue  6And note, too, that the author of the majority opinion recently joined a statement, written by another member of the majority, lamenting that Obergefell deprived States of the ability to resolve th[e] question [of same-sex marriage] through legislation. Davis v. Ermold, 592 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (statement of THOMAS, J.) (slip op., at 1). That might sound familiar. Cf. ante, at 44 (lamenting that Roe short-circuited the democratic process). And those two Justices hardly seemed content to let the matter rest: The Court, they said, had created a problem that only it can fix. Davis, 592 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).      26 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting in this very case. See ante, at 7 ([T]his case does not present the opportunity to reject those precedents). But he lets us know what he wants to do when they are. [I]n future cases, he says, we should reconsider all of this Courts substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell. Ante, at 3; see also supra, at 25, and n. 6. And when we reconsider them? Then we have a duty to overrul[e] these demonstrably erroneous decisions. Ante, at 3. So at least one Justice is planning to use the ticket of todays decision again and again and again. Even placing the concurrence to the side, the assurance in todays opinion still does not work. Or at least that is so if the majority is serious about its sole reason for overturning Roe and Casey: the legal status of abortion in the 19th century. Except in the places quoted above, the state interest in protecting fetal life plays no part in the majoritys analysis. To the contrary, the majority takes pride in not expressing a view about the status of the fetus. Ante, at 65; see ante, at 32 (aligning itself with Roes and Caseys stance of not deciding whether life or potential life is involved); ante, at 3839 (similar). The majoritys departure from Roe and Casey rests insteadand onlyon whether a womans decision to end a pregnancy involves any Fourteenth Amendment liberty interest (against which Roe and Casey balanced the state interest in preserving fetal life).7  7 Indulge a few more words about this point. The majority had a choice of two different ways to overrule Roe and Casey. It could claim that those cases underrated the States interest in fetal life. Or it could claim that they overrated a womans constitutional liberty interest in choosing an abortion. (Or both.) The majority here rejects the first path, and we can see why. Taking that route would have prevented the majority from claiming that it means only to leave this issue to the democratic processthat it does not have a dog in the fight. See ante, at 3839,

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Thomas concurrence makes clear that he is not on board with the majority opinion. He states that nothing in today's opinion casts doubt on non-abortion precedents, and that he only means that they are not at issue. He also notes that the author of the majority opinion recently joined a statement written by another member of the majority, lamenting that Obergefell deprived States of the ability to resolve the question of same-sex marriage through legislation.
