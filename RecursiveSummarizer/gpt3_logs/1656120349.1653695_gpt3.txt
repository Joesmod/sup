dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Elena Kagan. The majority opinion argues that Roe and its progeny, Casey v. Planned Parenthood, are "wrongly decided" and should be overruled. The opinion argues that there is no "deeply rooted" constitutional right to abortion in this country's history and tradition, and that the power to regulate abortion should be returned to the states. The dissent argues that Roe and Casey should be upheld as precedent, and that the majority opinion "ignores nearly 50 years of precedent" and puts women's health and lives at risk.  The Court begins by noting that, a century after the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, it is well-established that laws prohibiting abortion, like the Texas law at issue in Roe v. Wade, are permissible exercises of state regulatory authority. The Court then observes that, in the more than half a century since Roe was decided, a majority of the States have asked the Court to overturn that decision. The Court next turns to the dissent's argument that the right to abortion is rooted in this country's history and tradition. The Court explains that, because the dissent cannot argue that the abortion right is rooted in this Nation's history and tradition, it instead relies on the proposition that the "constitutional tradition" is "not captured whole at a single moment," and that its "meaning gains content from the long sweep of our history and from successive judicial precedents." The Court observes that, under the dissent's proposed test, Roe v. Wade would surely be wrong, because abortion was never allowed (except to save the life of the mother) in a majority of States for over 100 years before that decision was handed down. The Court also explains that it is impossible to defend Roe on the basis of prior precedent because all of the precedents Roe cited, including Griswold v. Connecticut and Eisenstadt v. Baird, were critically different for a reason: None of those cases involved the destruction of what Roe called "potential life." The Court then turns to the dissent's argument that, under the doctrine of stare decisis, Roe and subsequent decisions that have accepted Roe's interpretation of the Constitution are entitled to careful and respectful consideration. The Court explains that, while adherence to precedent is important, it is not an "inexorable command," and there are occasions when past decisions should be overruled. The Court concludes that, in light of the history and tradition of the States in regulating abortion, as well as the lack of any serious discussion of the legitimacy of the States' interest in protecting fetal life in the dissent, this is one of those occasions.  In Obergefell v. Hodges, the Supreme Court held that the Constitution protects the right to same-sex marriage. In doing so, the Court rejected the argument that its decision would imperil other rights, such as the right to abortion. The Court also held that the doctrine of stare decisis counsels continued

RESPONSE:

The U.S. Supreme Court has issued a ruling that overturns Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that legalized abortion nationwide. In a 5-4 decision, the Court ruled that the Constitution does not protect a woman's right to abortion, and that the power to regulate abortion should be returned to the states. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the majority opinion, joined by Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh. Chief Justice John Roberts joined the majority opinion, but wrote a separate concurrence. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote a dissent, joined by Justice Elena Kagan. The majority opinion argues that Roe and its progeny, Casey v. Planned Parenthood, are "wrongly decided" and should be overruled. The opinion argues that there is no "deeply rooted" constitutional right to abortion in this country's history and tradition, and that the power to regulate abortion should be returned to the states. The dissent argues that Roe and Casey should be upheld as precedent, and that the majority opinion "ignores nearly 50 years of precedent" and puts women's health and lives at risk.

The Court also held that the doctrine of stare decisis counsels continued respect for precedent, but that there are occasions when precedent should be overruled. The present case is one of those occasions, in light of the history and tradition of the States in regulating abortion, as well as the lack of any serious discussion of the legitimacy of the States' interest in protecting fetal life in the dissent.
