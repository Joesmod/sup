communities in this area don't have that option.  They don't have the option to access the rest of our city.  And so it is an issue of equity and fairness.  And really, our infrastructure, our public transit is the backbone and skeleton of our city and so I would urge others to vote yes as well.  Thank you, all the women on the head of members of the body that wish to speak to this matter.  The chair recognizes all of an urban.  What I mean.  I've done anything with what what.

And there's nothing wrong with that because at the end of the day, as, as a former CPS chair Michael Scott's would always tell us a rising tide lifts all boats.  It's an opportunity to lift a community group of communities on the far south side, which will help lift us all connecting individuals to jobs that may be on the other side of town imagine one person said she takes her two hours to take a bus to another bus to a train to another bus, just to go to school.  And that should not be in a world class city, such as ours so today I hope that we all can find it in our hearts to pass the revenue, so that this can happen for those residents that live in our garden that are literally, I won't say trapped but transit star.  And that can transform the rest of the city of Chicago.  I also talked about how the blue line in the red line and other pieces by transportation system need to be kept.  We as a city have to work together.  As we, as I recall, the meeting I brought my daughter to because I didn't have a babysitter she was still in a carriage to pass the money for the red,
