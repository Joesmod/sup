murder if the woman died from the attempt. The Solicitor General suggests that history supports an abortion right because of the common law's failure to criminalize abortion before quickening, but the insistence on quickening was not universal, and regardless, the fact that many states in the late 18th and early 19th century did not criminalize pre-quickening abortions does not mean that anyone thought the states lacked the authority to do so. Instead of seriously pressing the argument that the abortion right itself has deep roots, supporters of Roe and Casey contend that the abortion right is an integral part of a broader entrenched right. Roe termed this a right to privacy, and Casey described it as the freedom to make "intimate and personal choices" that are "central to personal dignity and autonomy." Ordered liberty sets limits and defines the boundary between competing interests. Roe and Casey each struck a particular balance between the interests of a woman who wants an abortion and the interests of what they termed "potential life." Roe, 410 U. S., at 150; Casey, 505 U. S., at 852. But the people of the various states may evaluate those interests differently. The Nation's historical understanding of ordered liberty does not prevent the people's elected representatives from making judgments about the meaning of life and the proper balance between competing interests.

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court of the United States issued its long-awaited ruling on the constitutionality of abortion regulation in the case of June Medical Services LLC v. Russo. In a 5-4 decision, the Court struck down a Louisiana law requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, finding that the law placed an undue burden on women seeking abortions. The majority opinion, written by Justice Stephen Breyer, was joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. Chief Justice John Roberts filed a concurring opinion. Justice Clarence Thomas filed a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch. In his majority opinion, Justice Breyer began by reviewing the history of abortion regulation in the United States, starting with the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973. He noted that the Roe decision had been increasingly criticized in recent years, with some calling for it to be overturned. Breyer then turned to the specific Louisiana law at issue in the case. He found that the law would have closed two of the state's three abortion clinics, and would have left only one clinic open that could serve the entire state. This would have placed an undue burden on women seeking abortions, in violation of the Supreme Court's previous rulings. In his concurring opinion, Chief Justice Roberts wrote that he did not agree with the reasoning of the majority opinion, but nonetheless concurred in the judgment striking down the Louisiana law. He stated that the Court's precedent in Planned Parenthood v. Casey required him to reach this conclusion. In his dissenting opinion, Justice Thomas argued that the Supreme Court should have overturned the Roe decision. He criticized the majority opinion for its reliance on the Casey decision, which he argued was wrongly decided. Thomas also argued that the Louisiana law at issue in the case did not impose an undue burden on women seeking abortions.
