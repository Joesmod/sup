PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


contractors has become extremely different.  So I think that what we're talking about, and again, agree with all to protect what is working, but we do need to change what is not working.  And I think that we have seen is the difficulties of small contractors, minority contractors, that once they start thriving, are not able to compete with the big contractors, white contractors overwhelmingly, almost 100%.  And it's very rare for a small contractor, minority or women or contractor to get to that point.  So again, I think I will reiterate my colleagues, Sawyer's, Alderman Sawyer's question, in terms of let's maintain, yes, what is working, but how do we get to that point? Because right now what we have are contractors that are protected and monopolies we know that hurt our economy.  And we've seen the inequity in the city, are hurting also our ability to encourage minority growth and women growth.  Well, again, I think that we made some recommendations to try to move that needle and increase that growth.  I can't stress enough about the prompt payment, because people told me point blank, they don't wanna be primes for the city because the risk is too great on the payment side.  Some of the larger contractors, prime contractors who are supportive of the program, will pay their MBE subs before they've been paid by the city.  If you're the prime, you're not gonna get that break.  So the payment issue is really, it's just huge.  Capacity building programs, I think really a serious bonding and financing program can go a long way towards helping these firms to be able to grow and bond bigger jobs.  That's very important.  Trying to unbundle the contract so that the smaller firms can do the work as primes.  Beefing up the small business initiative and the mid-size business initiative will probably help.  Making sure that people have a way to navigate through the bureaucracy, that there's transparency.  If you're having a problem, who do you call? You can call DPS, but their
