RESPONSE:

The U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade decision featured a lengthy survey of history, but much of its discussion was irrelevant, and the Court made no effort to explain why it was included. For example, multiple paragraphs were devoted to an account of the views and practices of ancient civilizations where infanticide was widely accepted. See 410 U.S. at 130-132 (discussing ancient Greek and Roman practices). When it came to the most important historical fact - how the States regulated abortion when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted - the Court said almost nothing. It allowed that States had tightened their abortion laws "in the middle and late 19th century," but it implied that these laws might have been enacted not to protect fetal life but to further "a Victorian social concern" about "illicit sexual conduct." Roe's failure even to note the overwhelming consensus of state laws in effect in 1868 is striking. The Court also erroneously suggested - contrary to Bracton, Coke, Hale, Blackstone, and a wealth of other authority - that the common law had probably never really treated post-quickening abortion as a crime. This erroneous understanding appears to have played an important part in the Court's thinking because the opinion cited "the lenity of the common law" as one of the four factors that informed its decision. After surveying history, the opinion spent many paragraphs conducting the sort of fact-finding that might be undertaken by a legislative committee. This included a lengthy account of the "position of the American Medical Association" and "the position of the American Public Health Association," as well as the vote by the American Bar Association's House of Delegates in February 1972 on proposed abortion legislation. Finally, after all this, the Court turned to precedent. Citing a broad array of cases, the Court found support for a woman's right to abortion. However, the Court's reasoning was circular, as it based its decision on the fact that there was a long-standing tradition of abortion being legal - even though that tradition was only a few years old at the time of Roe.
