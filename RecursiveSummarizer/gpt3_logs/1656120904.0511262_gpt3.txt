Write a detailed summary of the following:

Mississippi enacted a ban on abortion procedures after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Other states quickly followed suit. In 2019, Mississippi decided that it had not gone far enough and passed a 6-week restriction. A state senator who championed both Mississippi laws said that the obvious goal was to test the limits of Roe v. Wade. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court signaled that Mississippi's stratagem would succeed. Texas was one of the first states to ban abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. It added to that restriction an unprecedented scheme to "evade judicial review" of the ban. The Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization upholds Mississippi's 15-week ban and opens the door for even more restrictive abortion bans in the future.  The Guttmacher Institute has released two reports on state policy trends in reproductive health and rights. In the first report, released in 2019, the authors note a wave of abortion bans being passed in states across the country. However, they also note that some states are fighting back against these bans, with several passing laws to protect or expand access to abortion. In the second report, released in 2020, the authors note that while the overall trend continues to be towards more restrictions on abortion, there has been some progress made in some states in terms of expanding access to reproductive health care. In 2019, the Mississippi legislature passed a law banning abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. This law was challenged in court, and in October 2019 the case was heard by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The court ultimately ruled in favor of the state, upholding the law. In 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court heard a case challenging a Louisiana law that required abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. The Court ruled in a 5-4 decision that the law was unconstitutional, with the majority opinion noting that the law would likely result in the closure of most abortion clinics in the state. However, in another 5-4 decision released today, the Court has overturned its previous decision in the Whole Woman's Health case and ruled that a Mississippi law banning abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy is constitutional. This decision effectively overturns Roe v. Wade and gives states the ability to ban abortion outright. The dissent in this case notes that the majority opinion is based on a "cynical maneuver" to overturn Roe v. Wade, and that this decision will have far-reaching consequences for reproductive health and rights in the United States.  The United States Supreme Court today overruled Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833 (1992). The Court did so on the basis of stare decisis, holding that the two cases were out of step with contemporary case law and had been effectively abrogated by subsequent decisions. In doing so, the Court paid tribute to the three Justices who wrote the
