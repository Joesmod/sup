In doing so, the Court has reaffirmed the basic principles of Roe and Casey: that the Constitution protects a woman's right to choose, and that this right is not absolute.  In Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the Supreme Court considered whether the Constitution protects a woman's right to choose to terminate a pregnancy. The Court held that Roe v. Wade, which recognized a woman's right to choose to terminate a pregnancy, was correctly decided. However, the Court also held that the viability line, which Roe established as the point at which a State's interest in protecting potential human life outweighed a woman's right to choose, was dictum and should be abandoned.  The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 7-2 decision, has overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, which had legalized abortion nationwide. The Court's ruling in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization now allows states to ban abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The Court's ruling was based on the argument that a state's interests in protecting the health of the mother and the life of the fetus are "legitimate" and "compelling" enough to justify a ban on abortion after 15 weeks. The Court also found that a ban on abortion after 15 weeks would not impose an undue burden on the woman's right to choose.
