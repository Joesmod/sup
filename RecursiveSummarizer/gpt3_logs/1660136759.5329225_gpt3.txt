of the bill authorizes the appropriation of funds to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to provide grants, loans, or other forms of financial assistance to states, municipalities, Tribal governments, and eligible recipients for the purposes of deploying or benefiting from zero emission technologies, including distributed technologies on residential rooftops, and to carry out other greenhouse gas emission reduction activities.  This section of the Clean Air Act authorizes appropriations for various programs aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and other air pollutants. These programs include a Low Emissions Electricity Program, consumer and industry outreach and education, technical assistance and partnerships with state, tribal and local governments, and assessment of anticipated reductions in emissions. A total of $25 million is appropriated for these activities in fiscal year 2022.  This section of the bill authorizes the appropriation of $250,000,000 for the Environmental Protection Agency to develop and carry out a program to support the development, enhanced standardization and transparency, and reporting criteria for environmental product declarations that include measurements of the embodied greenhouse gas emissions of the material or product associated with all relevant stages of production, use, and disposal.

This section also imposes a charge on methane emissions that exceed an applicable waste emissions threshold from an owner or operator of an applicable facility that reports more than 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent of greenhouse gases emitted per year.  The proposed rule would exempt emissions that exceed the waste emissions threshold if they are caused
