CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Department of Planning is requesting acquisition authority for properties located at 518-524 East 47th Street and 526 East 47th Street. This is in order to improve the safety and condition of the property, which has over 50 city violations. The department hopes to purchase the property, but this is not guaranteed. If they are successful, it will benefit the city by improving the condition of the property and making it safer for the community.
