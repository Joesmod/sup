Write a concise summary of the following:

dissent in Roe, Justice Rehnquist indicated that an exception to a States restriction on abortion would be constitutionally required when an abortion is necessary to save the life of the mother. See Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, 173 (1973). Abortion statutes traditionally and currently provide for an exception when an abortion is necessary to protect the life of the mother. Some statutes also provide other exceptions. Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 5 KAVANAUGH, J., concurring amendments. See generally Amdt. 9; Amdt. 10; Art. I, 8; Art. V; J. Sutton, 51 Imperfect Solutions: States and the Making of American Constitutional Law 721, 203216 (2018); A. Amar, Americas Constitution: A Biography 285291, 315347 (2005). The Constitution does not grant the nine unelected Members of this Court the unilateral authority to rewrite the Constitution to create new rights and liberties based on our own moral or policy views. As Justice Rehnquist stated, this Court has not been granted a roving commission, either by the Founding Fathers or by the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment, to strike down laws that are based upon notions of policy or morality suddenly found unacceptable by a majority of this Court. Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, 467 (1972) (dissenting opinion); see Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 720721 (1997); Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S. 261, 292293 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring). This Court therefore does not possess the authority either to declare a constitutional right to abortion or to declare a constitutional prohibition of abortion. See Casey, 505 U. S., at 953 (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); id., at 980 (opinion of Scalia, J.); Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, 177 (1973) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting); Doe v. Bolton, 410 U. S. 179, 222 (1973) (White, J., dissenting). In sum, the Constitution is neutral on the issue of abortion and allows the people and their elected representatives to address the issue through the democratic process. In my respectful view, the Court in Roe therefore erred by taking sides on the issue of abortion. II The more difficult question in this case is stare decisis that is, whether to overrule the Roe decision. The principle of stare decisis requires respect for the   6 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION KAVANAUGH, J., concurring Courts precedents and for the accumulated wisdom of the judges who have previously addressed the same issue. Stare decisis is rooted in Article III of the Constitution and is fundamental to the American judicial system and to the stability of American law. Adherence to precedent is the norm, and stare decisis imposes a high bar before this Court may overrule a precedent. This Courts history shows, however, that stare decisis is not absolute, and indeed cannot be absolute. Otherwise, as the Court today explains, many long-sinceoverruled cases such as Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537 (1896); Lochner v. New

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court does not have the authority to declare a constitutional right to abortion or to declare a constitutional prohibition of abortion. However, the principle of stare decisis is not absolute, and the Court may overrule a precedent if it is necessary to do so.
