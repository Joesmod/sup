RESPONSE:

This section defines the terms "extended-monopoly drug" and "long-monopoly drug" for purposes of the drug pricing provisions in this bill. An extended-monopoly drug is a selected drug for which at least 12, but fewer than 16, years have elapsed since its approval or licensure. A long-monopoly drug is a selected drug for which at least 16 years have elapsed since its approval or licensure. Vaccines are excluded from both definitions.
