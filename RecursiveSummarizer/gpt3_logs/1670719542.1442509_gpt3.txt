CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

In the conversation, the participants discuss whether or not a website designer can refuse to provide services to a same-sex couple. Under the Hurley framework, it is unlikely that someone would only refuse to serve black Americans in an interracial marriage context. However, even if the website designer could not refuse to provide services to a same-sex couple, it would not be applicable to the case at hand.
