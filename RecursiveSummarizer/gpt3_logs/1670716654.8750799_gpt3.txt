county.  The case was actually filed by I believe three white mechanical firms, as well as the Memphis mechanical contractors association.  It's been pending for a couple years actually, but I certainly haven't heard that it was because of some council member, you know Memphis mechanical contractors association has been on record for years now.  We've done a lot of work in Memphis over the years, I'm as being opposed to the program but so that's not my understanding my understanding is that this case was filed by white contractors and a contracting organization is a straight up facial challenge to the county's ordinance.
