PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:

fact [is] how the States regulated abortion when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted); see also ante, at 5, 16, and n. 24, 23, 25, 28. If the ratifiers did not understand something as central to freedom, then neither can we. Or said more particularly: If those people did not understand reproductive rights as part of the guarantee of liberty conferred in the Fourteenth Amendment, then those rights do not exist. As an initial matter, note a mistake in the just preceding sentence. We referred there to the people who ratified the Fourteenth Amendment: What rights did those people have in their heads at the time? But, of course, people did not ratify the Fourteenth Amendment. Men did. So it is perhaps not so surprising that the ratifiers were not perfectly attuned to the importance of reproductive rights for womens liberty, or for their capacity to participate as equal members of our Nation. Indeed, the ratifiersboth in 1868 and when the original Constitution was approved in 1788 Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 15 BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting did not understand women as full members of the community embraced by the phrase We the People. In 1868, the first wave of American feminists were explicitly toldof course by menthat it was not their time to seek constitutional protections. (Women would not get even the vote for another half-century.) To be sure, most women in 1868 also had a foreshortened view of their rights: If most men could not then imagine giving women control over their bodies, most women could not imagine having that kind of autonomy. But that takes away nothing from the core point. Those responsible for the original Constitution, including the Fourteenth Amendment, did not perceive women as equals, and did not recognize womens rights. When the majority says that we must read our foundational charter as viewed at the time of ratification (except that we may also check it against the Dark Ages), it consigns women to second-class citizenship. Casey itself understood this point, as will become clear. See infra, at 2324. It recollected with dismay a decision this Court issued just five years after the Fourteenth Amendments ratification, approving a States decision to deny a law license to a woman and suggesting as well that a woman had no legal status apart from her husband. See 505 U. S., at 896897 (majority opinion) (citing Bradwell v. State, 16 Wall. 130 (1873)). There was a time, Casey explained, when the Constitution did not protect men and women alike. 505 U. S., at 896. But times had changed. A womans place in society had changed, and constitutional law had changed along with it. The relegation of women to inferior status in either the public sphere or the family was no longer consistent with our understanding of the Constitution. Id., at 897. Now, [t]he Constitution protects all individuals, male or female, from the abuse of governmental power or unjustified state interference. Id., at

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The majority opinion in the abortion case Roe v. Wade is based on a misinterpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment, according to the dissent. The amendment was ratified by men, who at the time did not view women as equals. The dissent argues that the Constitution has evolved since then to protect all individuals, regardless of gender, from abuse or unjustified interference by the government.
