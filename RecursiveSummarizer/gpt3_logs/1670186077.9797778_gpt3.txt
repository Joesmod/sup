all of us, trust me, have kind of combed our communities, but I think looking at it citywide, I think that's a role that AIS would be is best suited to do, working with I think OEMC as well.  So we're at November 2nd or 3rd today.  It's going to be very cold.  So I think that the sooner the better, but I look forward to working with you as a chairman of the Housing and Real Estate Committee and look forward to your confirmation.  Thank you.  Yes.  Thank you, Alderman.  And yes, AIS is taking the lead on this issue.  We'll be working with a brokerage firm to help us identify a portfolio of facilities that can work for, you know, different populations needs.  So we are starting that work.  Thank you.

And I think that over the last few years, we've been missing that opportunity.  So I'm glad to hear that in talking to you yesterday, but what your vision is.

And that's been the reason why the Economic Capital Technology Committee has been very aggressive, because we can't continue to go back to taxpayers every time we're short.  We've got to find ways to utilize technology to deliver services.  I often say that the city of Chicago, we don't manufacture or sell widgets, we sell a service.  And technology is going to be an opportunity for us to deliver those services in an efficient manner.  So I'm looking forward to working with you.  I'm very excited about your appointment and what it is that you have and what
