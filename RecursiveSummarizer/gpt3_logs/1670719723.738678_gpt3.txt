I think the Court's opinion in Fulton gives some guidance and says more selectivity, more individualized review is less likely to be a public accommodation, and in contrast, an entity that generally holds itself out as open to the public can't escape the public accommodations laws just by imposing a discriminatory limitation or some pretense of selectivity.
