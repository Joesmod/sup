relationships and in planning their lives. The legal framework Roe and Casey developed to balance the competing interests in this sphere has proved workable in courts across the country. No recent developments, in either law or fact, have eroded or cast doubt on those precedents. Nothing, in short, has changed. Indeed, the Court in Casey already found all of that to be true. Casey is a precedent about precedent. It reviewed the same arguments made here in support of overruling Roe, and it found that doing so was not warranted. The Court reverses course today for one reason and one reason only: because the composition of this Court has changed. Stare decisis, this Court has often said, contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process by ensuring that decisions are founded in the law rather than in the proclivities of individuals. Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991); Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254, 265 (1986). Today, the proclivities of individuals rule. The Court departs from its obligation to faithfully and impartially apply the law. We dissent. I We start with Roe and Casey, and with their deep connections to a broad swath of this Courts precedents. To hear the majority tell the tale, Roe and Casey are aberrations: They came from nowhere, went nowhereand so are easy to excise from this Nations constitutional law. That is not true. After describing the decisions themselves, we explain how they are rooted inand themselves led toother rights giving individuals control over their bodies and their most personal and intimate associations. The majority does not wish to talk about these matters for obvious reasons; to do so would both ground Roe and Casey in this Courts precedents and reveal the broad implications of todays decision. But the facts will not so handily disappear. Roe and Casey were from the beginning, and are even more now, embedded  Cite as: 597 U.

Those legal concepts, one might even say, have gone far toward defining what it means to be an American. For in this Nation, we do not believe that a government controlling all private choices is compatible with a free people. So we do not (as the majority insists today) place everything within the reach of majorities and [government] officials. West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, 638 (1943). We believe in a Constitution that puts some issues off limits to majority rule. Even in the face of public opposition, we uphold the right of individualsyes, including womento make their own choices and chart their own futures. Or at least, we did once. A Some half-century ago, Roe struck down a state law making it a crime to perform an abortion unless its purpose was to save a womans life. The Roe Court knew it was treading on difficult and

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that legalized abortion in the United States. In a close 5-4 decision, the Court ruled that states may now ban abortion outright or place severe restrictions on the procedure. The decision is a major victory for anti-abortion activists and a devastating blow to women's reproductive rights.
