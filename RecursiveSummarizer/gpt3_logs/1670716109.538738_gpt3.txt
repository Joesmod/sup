freedom deserve this, and more.  Thank you, Alderman Villegas Alderman Austin.  Thank you.  Susie I'll just say one, it's been an honor to work with you as a budget director.  I appreciate your working with us.  These positive things I'll point out in the edits that are in here one is the going from 800 units to 1200 units for rapid rehousing, which is going to get, you know, 400 more people, actually, I think it was 400 last year in the introduced budget it was 800 now it's going to 1200.  And that's going to streamline getting people off the street and into housing so I think that's critically important.  In addition to four more positions for homeless outreach, which is again critical that's on the ground, people out in communities across the city.

There's a community liaison position which will be helpful in bridging that divide.  I'm here in working with the Commission with the police and communities.  I do have to say, just on the Department of Environment.  I'm curious as to who's against this right because the black caucus supports it.  The progressive caucus supports it.  The Latino caucus supports it.  Others of us who are not in a caucus but are allied with all of those caucuses support this.  Is there like some group in the city or some entity that's out there that is like trying to prevent a Department of Environment because it just, I'm kind of scratching my head, trying to see why we don't do this.  And I've heard all the reasons but I'm just, is there some other reason that I'm not aware of.  So, to answer your question, you know, I'm not aware of anyone that's blocking or the obstacle I think you know where the discussion is is like, like, what does a full blown
