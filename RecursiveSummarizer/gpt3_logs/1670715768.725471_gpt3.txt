opportunity.  Thank you.  Alderman Lopez.  Thank you chairman.  So how long have they had this lease.  Michael.  So the lease was passed by City Council, September 9 2020 and executed shortly afterwards.  And does the city of Chicago provide funding to the person little village community mental health center to operate in the city of Chicago.  May May that is something that Paul would be better equest to answer.  Thank you so much.  Yes, in fact, you know we will receive funding through multiple funding streams.  That is, you know, Cook County, the state of Illinois, the part of the visual mental health and the city of Chicago, we have received federal pass through funding.  And specifically to operate outside that is sustained, mostly with the division of mental health which is the state of Illinois.  So respectfully how much do you get from the city of Chicago.  I think, you know, I can get back into into our, my finance department and provide information, definitely to the committee.  Thank you chairman, if we could get that provided through the chair because I understand the value of providing service and ensuring that we have service providers, particularly in some of our, often, disadvantaged neighborhoods or forgotten neighborhoods, like the southeast side of Chicago.  However, I think a lot of people will raise the question of whether or not giving a property that receives millions of dollars, $600,000 building for free is the right thing to do when taxpayers are on the hook for so many other things so I look forward to the discussion but hope that we bet in mind, especially when we look at know.  The next item is a church which undoubtedly serves the community and we're selling them a parcel of property for $90,000.  And we're giving a beautiful building with mental health provider for dollar.  I think we just need to be aware of the inconsistencies and the inequities of what we're doing with our sales of property.  Thank you chairman.  Thank you, Paul if


CONCISE SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

The city of Chicago is selling a property to a church for $90,000, and giving a mental health provider a building for $1. Some people question whether this is fair, given that taxpayers are responsible for funding many other things.
