Thank you for giving me this opportunity to talk.  I'm a motorized wheelchair user.  Like I said, my name is Abla Garib.  I live in the city.  So I just wanted to share my experience so you can understand the urgency of having this include this plow, the snow off the sidewalk.  So as I attempt to use my motorized wheelchair to go to my doctor appointment, I've been stuck a lot of times unable to make my appointments because usually they plow the snow and put it right where the crossroads are and I can't get through or they make it so narrow that the wheelchair can't go through.

As has been said before, only two thirds of Chicagoans use a car to get around, yet 100% of the city streets are cleared.  Yet 100% of people in the city of Chicago use a sidewalk day to day to get around.  I want to call upon Chicago's equity statement of principles.  It's supposed to, in the description on the Chicago website, prioritize access and opportunities for groups that are underserved and underutilized.  This specifically translates to our most vulnerable road users who are pedestrians.  As of now, we have support of over 10 alderman.  We have the first ward, the
