PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


the crushing burden that APS has in terms of processing all this stuff, that people's certification dates would go by and they're literally their certification would expire.  Well, of course the city would send you a letter that said, you're not really expired and you're still on the program, but this caused a lot of anxiety, needless to say, but it also meant that some prime contractors out of what I would consider an overabundance of caution, but you know, that's their business, would refuse to utilize a firm that actually was still certified, because their certification letter said they weren't.  So we were just trying to kind of modernize, streamline, reduce the burdens as much as we could.  One thing I haven't said so far, but here's my chance, I guess, which is that the functions of this program just need more resources.  They need more staff.  There's just no other way to put it.  I can have all the great ideas in the world, but if there's nobody to execute them, then, you know, this isn't going to help the certified firms.  And so, you know, I just feel like I beg you all to try to find the resources so that the program and DPS Missimenis have the folks to actually be able to speed up things, both payment, certification, compliance, outreach.  All of this takes people.  And for a program of this magnitude, it's sort of surprisingly thinly staffed.  So I don't have a number of people in mind, but I certainly do see the need for additional resources to be able to execute these things and really increase the ability to help the minority and women firms to succeed.  I thank you for even sharing that, Ms.  Hall, and as the budget chairman, I will definitely reach out to you just to see what's on your mind.  In particular areas, in particular areas that maybe we should look at because I think all of the all them in here, you know, this is, we want to see more opportunities go to black and brown businesses.  And if there's something that we need to do to buttress


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The city's Affirmative Procurement Program (APP) is in need of more resources in order to effectively help minority and women-owned businesses succeed. APP is currently thinly staffed, and this is hindering its ability to process certification applications and payments, as well as comply with regulations. Outreach efforts are also being hindered. Additional staff is needed in order to execute the program's goals and help businesses thrive.
