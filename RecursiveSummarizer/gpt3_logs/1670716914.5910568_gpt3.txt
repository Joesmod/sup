PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


hey, we don't know how we know this stuff, or we can't figure it out.  That I wanna make sure that on our end, that we're doing our due diligence to try to meet what those points could be in a way that lets people know that, this is a group of folks that have traditionally been discriminated against, and also do it in a way where it doesn't make other groups feel as though they're losing something and kind of trying to get everything to move forward.  So I understand.  Right, right, right.  Yeah, so if you could, would that be okay to send kind of like, what those data points, what the requests of something like that could look like, so that way when I'm having conversations with those LGBT chambers and such, we can kind of like continue.  But I can, but I at least wanna try to be clear.  I mean, we're talking about data points, we're talking about census data, we're talking about Dunn and Bradstreet files, we're talking about things that those chambers don't control in any way, shape or form.  We certainly do ask for them to share their membership lists.  Quite frankly, they know people won't usually, but when we can get them, we certainly do want to include those firms in our outreach, things like vendor registration.  It gets complicated really fast.  What are you gonna ask people about? How, what does the certification look like? We have worked with the Illinois LGBT chamber.  I'm trying to think what the gentleman's name is there.  I'm just having a blank on it.  But anyway, to get their members to participate, but from a statistical and quantitative standpoint, you're talking about national databases that would need the same level of reliability as we have about everything else.  I mean, we've been collecting data about race in this country for a very, very long time, so we've got a lot of it.  But sexual orientation or preference and gender identity, whole new set of questions.  So certainly I know that the city has made some efforts in particular about that.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The city is looking to include LGBT chambers in their outreach efforts, but it is complicated because there is not a lot of reliable data on sexual orientation and gender identity. The city has worked with the Illinois LGBT chamber in the past, but it is difficult to get accurate information on chamber members.
