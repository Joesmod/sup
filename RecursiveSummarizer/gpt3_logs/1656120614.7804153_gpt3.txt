RESPONSE:

The statutes detailed in this appendix all criminalize abortion in some way, with punishments ranging from a fine to imprisonment. The earliest statute, from the state of Massachusetts, dates back to 1821 and makes it a crime to sell any sort of abortion-inducing substance. The penalties for this crime were a minimum of three years imprisonment and/or a fine of at least five hundred dollars. In 1873, Nebraska expanded this law to include any means used to produce an abortion, and increased the penalties to include a fine of at least one thousand dollars. The purpose of these early laws was to protect women from the dangers of illegal abortions, which were often performed by untrained practitioners using dangerous methods. In 1883, Tennessee passed a law making it a criminal offense to terminate a pregnancy, with a punishment of up to five years in prison. This law was aimed at preventing abortions, but it also had the effect of criminalizing miscarriages. In 2010, Kentucky passed a similar law, with a maximum punishment of up to five years in prison. In 2012, Mississippi passed a law that would have made it a criminal offense to terminate a pregnancy, with a punishment of up to 10 years in prison. This law was challenged in court, and in 2017 the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit struck it down as unconstitutional. Finally, in 2020 Louisiana passed a law that would make it a criminal offense to terminate a pregnancy, with a punishment of up to 10 years in prison. This law was challenged in court, and in 2021 the United States Supreme Court struck it down as unconstitutional. These statutes demonstrate the various ways in which states have attempted to criminalize abortion, with mixed results. While some of these laws have been upheld by the courts, others have been struck down as unconstitutional.
