Write a concise summary of the following:

asserts that only 26 States prohibited abortion at all stages, but that brief incorrectly excludes West Virginia and Nebraska from its count. Compare Brief for American Historical Association 2728 (citing Quay), with Appendix A, infra.   24 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court criminalized abortion at all stages, all but one did so by 1910. See ibid. The trend in the Territories that would become the last 13 States was similar: All of them criminalized abortion at all stages of pregnancy between 1850 (the Kingdom of Hawaii) and 1919 (New Mexico). See Appendix B, infra; see also Casey, 505 U. S., at 952 (Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); Dellapenna 317319. By the end of the 1950s, according to the Roe Courts own count, statutes in all but four States and the District of Columbia prohibited abortion however and whenever performed, unless done to save or preserve the life of the mother. 410 U. S., at 139.35 This overwhelming consensus endured until the day Roe was decided. At that time, also by the Roe Courts own count, a substantial majority30 Statesstill prohibited abortion at all stages except to save the life of the mother. See id., at 118, and n. 2 (listing States). And though Roe discerned a trend toward liberalization in about onethird of the States, those States still criminalized some abortions and regulated them more stringently than Roe would allow. Id., at 140, and n. 37; Tribe 2. In short, the  35The statutes of three States (Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania) prohibited abortions performed unlawfully or without lawful justification. Roe, 410 U. S., at 139 (internal quotation marks omitted). In Massachusetts, case law held that abortion was allowed when, according to the judgment of physicians in the relevant community, the procedure was necessary to preserve the womans life or her physical or emotional health. Commonwealth v. Wheeler, 315 Mass. 394, 395, 53 N. E. 2d 4, 5 (1944). In the other two States, however, there is no clear support in case law for the proposition that abortion was lawful where the mothers life was not at risk. See State v. Brandenberg, 137 N. J. L. 124, 58 A. 2d 709 (1948); Commonwealth v. Trombetta, 131 Pa. Super. 487, 200 A. 107 (1938). Statutes in the two remaining jurisdictions (the District of Columbia and Alabama) permitted abortion to preserve the mothers health. Roe, 410 U. S., at 139. Case law in those jurisdictions does not clarify the breadth of these exceptions.  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 25 Opinion of the Court Courts opinion in Roe itself convincingly refutes the notion that the abortion liberty is deeply rooted in the history or tradition of our people. Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747, 793 (1986) (White, J., dissenting). d The inescapable conclusion is that a right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the Nations history and traditions.
