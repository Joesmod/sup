facial challenge in part -- or, I'm sorry,  pre-enforcement challenge, in part because we need more facts and we don't have them, we are  not foreclosing the possibility that there is  narrow relief in future cases with concrete  facts. JUSTICE KAGAN: Last question. You said to Justice Jackson that you didn't want to belabor the point, but her hypothetical is exactly the kind of hypothetical that you're concerned about. You must have done many moots of this case and thought of many hypotheticals. What are your two ones that you're like killers? (Laughter).
