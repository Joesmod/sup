deciding how abortion should be regulated. Pp. 11–30. (3) Finally, the Court considers whether a right to obtain an abortion is part of a broader entrenched right that is supported by other precedents. The Court concludes the right to obtain an abortion cannot be justified as a component of such a right. Attempts to justify abortion through appeals to a broader right to autonomy and to define one’s “concept of existence” prove too much. Casey, 505 U. S., at 851. Those criteria, at a high level of generality, could license fundamental rights to illicit drug use, prostitution, and the like. What sharply distinguishes the abortion right from the rights recognized in the cases on which Roe and Casey rely is something that both those decisions acknowledged: Abortion is different because it destroys what Roe termed “potential life” and what the law challenged in this case calls an “unborn human being.” None of the other decisions cited by Roe and Casey involved the critical moral question posed by abortion. Accordingly, those cases do not support the right to obtain an abortion, and the Court’s conclusion that the Constitution does not confer such a right does not undermine them in any way. Pp. 30–32. (b) The doctrine of stare decisis does not counsel continued acceptance of Roe and Casey. Stare decisis plays an important role and protects the interests of those who have taken action in reliance on a past decision. It “reduces incentives for challenging settled precedents, saving parties and courts the expense of endless relitigation.” Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC, 576 U. S. 446, 455. It “contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.” Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827. And it restrains judicial hubris by respecting the judgment of those who grappled with important questions in the past. But stare decisis is not an inexorable command, Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 233, and “is at its weakest when [the Court] interpret[s] the Constitution,” Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 235. Some of the Court’s most important constitutional decisions have overruled prior precedents. See, e.g., Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483, 491 (overruling the infamous decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537, and its progeny). The Court’s cases have identified factors that should be considered in deciding when a precedent should be overruled. Janus v. State, County, and Municipal Employees, 585 U. S. ___, ___–___. Five factors  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 5 Syllabus discussed below weigh strongly in favor of overruling Roe and Casey. Pp. 39–66. (1) The nature of the Court’s error. Like the infamous decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, Roe was also egregiously wrong and on a collision course with the Constitution from the day it was decided. Casey perpetuated its errors, calling both sides of the national controversy to resolve their debate, but in doing so, Casey necessarily declared a winning side. Those on the losing

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court of the United States issued its long-awaited ruling on the constitutionality of abortion regulation in the case of June Medical Services LLC v. Russo. In a 5-4 decision, the Court struck down a Louisiana law requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, finding that the law placed an undue burden on women seeking abortions. The majority opinion, written by Justice Stephen Breyer, was joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. Chief Justice John Roberts filed a concurring opinion. Justice Clarence Thomas filed a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch. In his majority opinion, Justice Breyer began by reviewing the history of abortion regulation in the United States, starting with the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973. He noted that the Roe decision had been increasingly criticized in recent years, with some calling for it to be overturned. Breyer then turned to the specific Louisiana law at issue in the case. He found that the law would have closed two of the state's three abortion clinics, and would have left only one clinic open that could serve the entire state. This would have placed an undue burden on women seeking abortions, in violation of the Supreme Court's previous rulings. In his concurring opinion, Chief Justice Roberts wrote that he did not agree with the reasoning of the majority opinion, but nonetheless concurred in the judgment striking down the Louisiana law. He stated that the Court's precedent in Planned Parenthood v. Casey required him to reach this conclusion. In his dissenting opinion, Justice Thomas wrote that the Court's previous decisions on abortion were "wholly without constitutional basis" and should be overturned. He argued that the Constitution does not protect a woman's right to an abortion, and that the Court's decisions on the matter had caused "profound damage to our constitutional order."
