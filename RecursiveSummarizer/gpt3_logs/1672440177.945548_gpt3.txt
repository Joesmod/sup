African-American community.  So here is a Jewish man standing up for other people who are also experiencing extreme discrimination.  He was doing that because he understood discrimination himself.  So our planet, if it ends, it will be because of people warring with each other just because of their beliefs or their looks.  It's just ludicrous, it's crazy.

The chair recognizing some school resource officers in the noble work that they did to support one of the students in our school.  The chair recognizes Alderman Talia Farrell.

And because the resolution is not very lengthy, Madam President, I move
