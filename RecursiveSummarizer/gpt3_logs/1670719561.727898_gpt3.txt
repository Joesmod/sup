WAGGONER: The clear -- JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: You're saying it's compelled speech, correct, not compelled service? MS. WAGGONER: I'm saying that in the public accommodation cases, this Court has routinely looked at whether there's speech and whether the message is affected and whether the objection lines up with the final speech. JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But the one -- one line -- MS. WAGGONER: That -- JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- that you're missing is Justice Gorsuch's line.
