This concludes our ordinance request for the amount of 36,263,000.  Are there any questions with that? Alderman Rosa Ramirez Rosa.  Yeah, so this for my clarification this is on item seven a these are the amendments to the.  This is item number six on the agenda.  This is the fund 925.  Oh, this is item six.  Okay, thank you so much.  All right, Alderman Tony.  I'm a couple of questions, specifically on the CTA outreach homelessness.  This is a 2 million expenditure, but is this the first time, is this an addition to what they're doing annually, or is this a first time outreach.  These are new dollars, but we do have the Department of Family and Support Services that may be able to speak to any additional programming that they received.  Good morning, Christine Riley, director homeless services family support services.  Yes, these are new dollars $2 million at the CTA will be providing the agencies that are currently contracted, or who are already awarded contractors to the Department of Family and Support Services.  So these are new dollars.  So, historically, there have been no dollars allocated for this issue from on these particular from CTA yes, that's a sad statement.  Yes, these are new dollars from CTA.  That's a very sad statement.  Because this is not a new issue.  I appreciate this allocation, but this is a problem.  One other question.  I see the HIV and COVID and stuff but can someone answer the question about MPV, is there federal dollars going to outreach for MPV.  Good morning, everybody
