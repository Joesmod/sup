case, it's beyond good, it's great.  I was floored literally.  I had a mentoring program when I was a young police officer, but what John and Kathy are doing goes beyond what is just your basic mentorship to help see one of the students at Foreman get into college and then to drive them all the way to college goes beyond what we see our police officers doing every day.
