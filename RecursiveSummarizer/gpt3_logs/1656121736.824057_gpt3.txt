To the majority balance is a dirty word, as moderation is a foreign concept. The majority would allow States to ban abortion from conception onward because it does not think forced childbirth at all implicates a womans rights to equality and freedom. Todays Court, that is, does not think there is anything of constitutional significance attached to a womans control of her body and the path of her life. Roe and Casey thought that one-sided view misguided. In some sense, that is the difference in a nutshell between our precedents and the majority opinion. The constitutional regime we have lived in for the last 50 years recognized competing interests, and sought a balance between them. The constitutional regime we enter today erases the womans interest and recognizes only the States (or the Federal Governments). B The majority makes this change based on a single question: Did the reproductive right recognized in Roe and Casey  of any significance. Ante, at 38. To the contrary. The liberty interests underlying those rights are, as we will describe, quite similar. See infra, at 2224. But only in the sphere of abortion is the state interest in protecting potential life involved. So only in that sphere, as both Roe and Casey recognized, may a State impinge so far on the liberty interest (barring abortion after viability and discouraging it before). The majoritys failure to understand this fairly obvious point stems from its rejection of the idea of balancing interests in this (or maybe in any) constitutional context. Cf. New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v. Bruen, 597 U. S. ___, ___, ______ (2022) (slip op., at 8, 1517). The majority thinks that a woman has no liberty or equality interest in the decision to bear a child, so a States interest in protecting fetal life necessarily prevails.  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 13 BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting exist in 1868, the year when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified? Ante, at 23. The majority says (and with this much we agree) that the answer to this question is no: In 1868, there was no nationwide right to end a pregnancy,

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization scoffs at the idea of balancing interests, castigating the dissent for repeatedly praising the balance the two cases arrived at. The majority would allow States to ban abortion from conception onward because it does not think forced childbirth at all implicates a woman's rights to equality and freedom. The dissenters argue that the liberty interests underlying the right to an abortion are quite similar to the liberty interests underlying the rights to contraception and same-sex marriage, and that the majority's failure to understand this fairly obvious point stems from its rejection of the idea of balancing interests in this (or maybe in any) constitutional context.
