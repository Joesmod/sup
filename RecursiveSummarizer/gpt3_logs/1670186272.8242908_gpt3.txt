CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The city of Chicago is proposing a new law that would require people who rent out their properties on platforms like Airbnb to pay a license fee of $250, plus a $60 fee for each unit they rent out. This would apply to people who rent out single units, like apartments or houses. The purpose of the fees is to generate revenue for the city and to crack down on illegal rental activity.
