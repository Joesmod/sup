Write a detailed summary of the following:

Amendment’s Due Process Clause. 505 U. S., at 846. The controlling opinion criticized and rejected Roe’s trimester scheme, 505 U. S., at 872, and substituted a new and obscure “undue burden” test. Casey, in short, either refused to reaffirm or rejected important aspects of Roe’s analysis, failed to remedy glaring deficiencies in Roe’s reasoning, endorsed what it termed Roe’s central holding while suggesting that a majority might not have thought it was correct, provided no new support for the abortion right other than Roe’s status as precedent, and imposed a new test with no firm grounding in constitutional text, history, or precedent. Pp. 45–56. (3) Workability. Deciding whether a precedent should be overruled depends in part on whether the rule it imposes is workable—that is, whether it can be understood and applied in a consistent and predictable manner. Casey’s “undue burden” test has scored poorly on the workability scale. The Casey plurality tried to put meaning into the “undue burden” test by setting out three subsidiary rules, but these rules created their own problems. And the difficulty of applying Casey’s new rules surfaced in that very case. Compare 505 U. S., at 881– 887, with id., at 920–922 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The experience of the Courts of Appeals provides further evidence that Casey’s “line between” permissible and unconstitutional restrictions “has proved to be impossible to draw with precision.” Janus, 585 U. S., at ___. Casey has generated a long list of Circuit conflicts. Continued adherence to Casey’s unworkable “undue burden” test would undermine, not advance, the “evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles.” Payne, 501 U. S., at 827. Pp. 56–62. (4) Effect on other areas of law. Roe and Casey have led to the distortion of many important but unrelated legal doctrines, and that effect provides further support for overruling those decisions. See Ramos v. Louisiana, 590 U. S. ___, ___ (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring in part). Pp. 62–63. (5) Reliance interests. Overruling Roe and Casey will not upend concrete reliance interests like those that develop in “cases involving property and contract rights.” Payne, 501 U. S., at 828. In Casey, the controlling opinion conceded that traditional reliance interests were       Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 7 Syllabus not implicated because getting an abortion is generally “unplanned activity,” and “reproductive planning could take virtually immediate account of any sudden restoration of state authority to ban abortions.” 505 U. S., at 856. Instead, the opinion perceived a more intangible form of reliance, namely, that “people [had] organized intimate relationships and made choices that define their views of themselves and their places in society . . . in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail” and that “[t]he ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of

RESPONSE:

The U. S. Supreme Court's decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey significantly altered the legal landscape surrounding abortion. Prior to Casey, the Court's decision in Roe v. Wade had established a nationwide right to abortion, and had set up a three-tiered system whereby states could only regulate abortion in certain ways during specific periods of pregnancy. In Casey, however, the Court rejected Roe's trimester scheme and instead adopted a new and less clear "undue burden" test. Since its inception, Casey's "undue burden" test has proven to be difficult to apply in a consistent and predictable manner. This has led to a number of Circuit conflicts, as well as to the distortion of many important but unrelated legal doctrines. Moreover, Casey's recognition of a more intangible form of reliance on abortion has made it even more difficult to overturn. Despite these challenges, there are several good reasons to overturn Casey and return to the pre-Casey legal landscape. First, Casey's "undue burden" test is unworkable and has caused more confusion than clarity. Second, Casey has led to the distortion of many important legal doctrines, and these effects are cumulatively damaging to the rule of law. Finally, there are no concrete reliance interests that would be harmed by overturning Casey, and indeed, many would benefit from a return to the clear and predictable legal landscape that existed prior to Casey.
