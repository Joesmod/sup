million women between the ages of 18–49 had ever “[t]aken steps to adopt a child” based on data collected from 2015–2019). Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 35 Opinion of the Court Both sides make important policy arguments, but supporters of Roe and Casey must show that this Court has the authority to weigh those arguments and decide how abortion may be regulated in the States. They have failed to make that showing, and we thus return the power to weigh those arguments to the people and their elected representatives. D 1 The dissent is very candid that it cannot show that a constitutional right to abortion has any foundation, let alone a “‘deeply rooted’” one, “‘in this Nation’s history and tradition.’” Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721; see post, at 12–14 (joint opinion of BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ.). The dissent does not identify any pre-Roe authority that supports such a right—no state constitutional provision or statute, no federal or state judicial precedent, not even a scholarly treatise. Compare post, at 12–14, n. 2, with supra, at 15–16, and n. 23. Nor does the dissent dispute the fact that abortion was illegal at common law at least after quickening; that the 19th century saw a trend toward criminalization of pre-quickening abortions; that by 1868, a supermajority of States (at least 26 of 37) had enacted statutes criminalizing abortion at all stages of pregnancy; that by the late 1950s at least 46 States prohibited abortion “however and whenever performed” except if necessary to save “the life of the mother,” Roe, 410 U. S., at 139; and that when Roe was decided in 1973 similar statutes were still in effect in 30 States. Compare post, at 12–14, nn. 2–3, with supra, at 23–25, and nn. 33–34.47 The dissent’s failure to engage with this long tradition is —————— 47By way of contrast, at the time Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965), was decided, the Connecticut statute at issue was an extreme outlier. See Brief for Planned Parenthood Federation of America, Inc. as Amicus Curiae in Griswold v. Connecticut, O. T. 1964, No. 496, p. 27.  36 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court devastating to its position. We have held that the “established method of substantive-due-process analysis” requires that an unenumerated right be “‘deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition’” before it can be recognized as a component of the “liberty” protected in the Due Process Clause. Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721; cf. Timbs, 586 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). But despite the dissent’s professed fidelity to stare decisis, it fails to seriously engage with that important precedent—which it cannot possibly satisfy. The dissent attempts to obscure this failure by misrepresenting our application of Glucksberg. The dissent suggests that we have focused only on “the legal status of abortion in the 19th century,” post, at 26, but our review of this Nation’s tradition extends well past that period. As explained, for more than

DETAILED SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution does not protect a woman's right to abortion, overturning the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. The 7-2 ruling was issued in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, with Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito writing the majority opinion. Justices Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Elena Kagan. The majority opinion argues that Roe and its progeny, Casey v. Planned Parenthood, are "wrongly decided" and should be overruled. The opinion argues that there is no "deeply rooted" constitutional right to abortion in this country's history and tradition, and that the power to regulate abortion should be returned to the states. The dissent argues that Roe and Casey should be upheld as precedent, and that the majority opinion "ignores nearly 50 years of precedent" and puts women's health and lives at risk.
