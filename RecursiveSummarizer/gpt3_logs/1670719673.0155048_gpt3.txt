So I've been thinking about a publishing house that says, we're not going to publish -- we support pro choice positions.

Does the publishing house have a First Amendment ability to select the kinds of books that it will publish along the lines of my  hypotheticals there?  MR.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The conversation is between Justice Gorsuch and Mr. Olson. They are discussing Colorado's education program and whether or not it violates the First Amendment. Mr. Olson believes it does not, but Justice Gorsuch is not convinced. Chief Justice Roberts then asks Justice Kavanaugh for his opinion. Justice Kavanaugh asks Mr. Olson what he thinks Colorado's position on the First Amendment could lead to in terms of a publishing house discriminating against certain authors based on their beliefs. Mr. Olson responds that a publishing house would still have a First Amendment right to do so, even if it were a public accommodation.
