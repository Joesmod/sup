side—those who sought to advance the State’s interest in fetal life—could no longer seek to persuade their elected representatives to adopt policies consistent with their views. The Court short-circuited the democratic process by closing it to the large number of Americans who disagreed with Roe. Pp. 43–45. (2) The quality of the reasoning. Without any grounding in the constitutional text, history, or precedent, Roe imposed on the entire country a detailed set of rules for pregnancy divided into trimesters much like those that one might expect to find in a statute or regulation. See 410 U. S., at 163–164. Roe’s failure even to note the overwhelming consensus of state laws in effect in 1868 is striking, and what it said about the common law was simply wrong. Then, after surveying history, the opinion spent many paragraphs conducting the sort of factfinding that might be undertaken by a legislative committee, and did not explain why the sources on which it relied shed light on the meaning of the Constitution. As to precedent, citing a broad array of cases, the Court found support for a constitutional “right of personal privacy.” Id., at 152. But Roe conflated the right to shield information from disclosure and the right to make and implement important personal decisions without governmental interference. See Whalen v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 599–600. None of these decisions involved what is distinctive about abortion: its effect on what Roe termed “potential life.” When the Court summarized the basis for the scheme it imposed on the country, it asserted that its rules were “consistent with,” among other things, “the relative weights of the respective interests involved” and “the demands of the profound problems of the present day.” Roe, 410 U. S., at 165. These are precisely the sort of considerations that legislative bodies often take into account when they draw lines that accommodate competing interests. The scheme Roe produced looked like legislation, and the Court provided the sort of explanation that might be expected from a legislative body. An even more glaring deficiency was Roe’s failure to justify the critical distinction it drew between pre- and post-viability abortions. See id., at 163. The arbitrary viability line, which Casey termed Roe’s central rule, has not found much support among philosophers and ethicists who have attempted to justify a right to abortion. The most obvious problem with any such      6 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION Syllabus argument is that viability has changed over time and is heavily dependent on factors—such as medical advances and the availability of quality medical care—that have nothing to do with the characteristics of a fetus. When Casey revisited Roe almost 20 years later, it reaffirmed Roe’s central holding, but pointedly refrained from endorsing most of its reasoning. The Court abandoned any reliance on a privacy right and instead grounded the abortion right entirely on the Fourteenth

DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

In 1973, the Supreme Court issued its Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion nationwide. The Court based its decision on a constitutional right to privacy, which it said included a woman's right to make decisions about her own body, including the decision to have an abortion. The Court also established a three-tiered system for regulating abortion, which placed different restrictions on abortion at different stages of pregnancy. Since Roe was decided, there has been a sharp divide in the United States over the issue of abortion. Those who support abortion rights have praised the decision as a victory for women's autonomy and privacy, while those who oppose abortion have criticized it as judicial overreach that has led to the taking of millions of innocent lives. In 1992, the Court revisited the issue of abortion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. The Court reaffirmed Roe's central holding that there is a constitutional right to abortion, but it rejected Roe's reasoning and instead grounded the right in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court also struck down several of the restrictions that had been placed on abortion under Roe, while upholding others. Since Casey was decided, the issue of abortion has remained highly divisive, with both sides continuing to argue passionately for their respective positions. The issue is likely to continue to be a contentious one in the years to come.
