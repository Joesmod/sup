departments but together, looking to add a second shift.  So that would be adding a second hour, all three teams.  So we are, the first thing that is happening is we are adding another new team.  We're adding a fourth we're adding a fourth team on the west side focused on substance use that will that will include a community paramedic and appear recovery specialist so that's the first thing that's happening.  And that is already in the works and being planned.  Then the next thing that will be happening will be together we're looking at both adding second shifts.  There are union negotiations and other things that go into doing that.  And then we've, we pulled data to identify the parts of the city, where the needs are greatest and we'll be looking to add additional teams there so it's it's happening really in stages, every time we add a new response or a new, a new type like the substance use that requires the state giving approval the sign off with 911, etc.  But that's, that's the, that's the plan sort of over this next year.

We don't spend it, it'll roll over because it is funded through the AARP, or the AARP fund specifically which goes till 2026.  Okay.  And, and my last line is just around the lead line replacement.  How much in the budget is
