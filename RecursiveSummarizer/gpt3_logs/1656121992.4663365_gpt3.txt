the past. There is no positive right to procure an abortion at any stage of pregnancy.  The quickening rule was a rule that distinguished between pre- and post-quickening abortions. The rule was abandoned in the 19th century. Treatise writers and commentators criticized the quickening distinction as neither in accordance with the result of medical experience, nor with the principles of the common law.  The quickening distinction was a rule of common law that held that abortions and miscarriages could only be punished if they occurred after the point of quickening, or when the fetus became animate. In 1803, the British Parliament made abortion a crime at all stages of pregnancy, and this law was adopted by many states in the US by 1868. The quickening distinction was thus no longer valid by the time the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified.  The Supreme Court has ruled that a right to abortion is not deeply rooted in the history or tradition of the United States.  The Court in Roe v. Wade could have said that the law has consistently condemned abortion, but instead relied on two articles by a pro-abortion advocate. These articles have been debunked by subsequent scholarship.  This is a discussion of the history of abortion law and whether or not there is a constitutional right to abortion. The author reviews scholarship on the topic and finds it lacking. He then looks at the history of abortion law and finds that while many states criminalized abortion after quickening, there was no universal consensus on when abortion should be criminalized. The author concludes that there is no clear constitutional right to abortion.  The argument that the 19th century abortion laws were motivated by a fear of Catholic immigrants and that White Protestant women were shirking their maternal duties is not supported by any real historical evidence.  The passage of laws restricting abortion was motivated not by hostility to Catholics and women, but by a sincere belief that abortion kills a human being. This belief is based on judicial decisions from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood did not question the good faith of abortion opponents.  The Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), K. Kortsmit et al., have released a report on abortion surveillance in the United States for 2019. The report includes data on the number of abortions, the reasons given for abortions, the methods used to obtain abortions, and complications from abortions. The report concludes that the number of abortions in the United States has declined in recent years, but that the rate of abortion has remained relatively stable.  The Supreme Court case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey considered the constitutionality of abortion and ultimately upheld the right to abortion. However, the Court also recognized that abortion is a unique act that destroys potential life. This recognition distinguishes the
