PROMPT:

Write an itemized summary of any proposed spending, starting with the amount proposed to spend and what that money spent will do in the following:


the ordinance that govern the redevelopment of the North Austin Community Center into a community and athletic center.  This is in the 37th Ward.  Alderman Mitt's project is at 1815 North Laramie Street.  The project is already under construction and is actually scheduled to be completed in November.  The project was the sale of land for $2.1 million to the North Austin Community Center.  In order to construct the athletic center, you see in the renderings here, that purchase amount was placed in the escrow account for use for environmental remediation expenses.  The remediation is complete.  However, there was a large amount of contaminated wood chips on site.  The escrow agreement did not specify that those are eligible project expenses.  The developer requested and the DPD approved that these contaminated wood chips should be included as eligible expenses so they could be counted towards the escrow drawdown.  We're simply here today to amend the ordinance to add a language that would allow again these contaminated wood chips to be an eligible expense for the escrow agreement.  It would only add $475,000 to the total amount that's been remediated to date and that amount is less than the $2.1 million escrow amount in total.  So as I said, the project is largely completed and it will be completed in November.  Here you have rendering the site plan and then some project construction photos that were shared to me by the development team who is actually here today as well as Alderman Metz in support of this project.  Thank you.  Mr.  Chairman, I'm sorry.  No one else was going to recognize Alderman Metz for this great project.  I needed to raise my hand because there is a substitute ordinance that I was sending in that's only going to change passage and publication for passage and approval of the ordinance.  So Alderman Metz, I think that that substitute was not gotten to us in a timely fashion and I think we're not prepared to entertain the substitute.  So I think
