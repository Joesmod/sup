Write a concise summary of the following:

as well as the conflicting predictive judgments about the future of state laws and public opinion on abortion, the Supreme Court has decided to overturn Roe v. Wade.  The Supreme Court has ruled on several key cases regarding contraception and marriage, including Griswold v. Connecticut, Eisenstadt v. Baird, Loving v. Virginia, and Obergefell v. Hodges. Today's decision does not overturn any of these previous rulings, but simply states that the fundamental question of whether or not abortion must be allowed throughout the United States is no longer something that the Court will decide. This issue will now be decided by the people and their elected representatives through the constitutional processes of democratic self-government.  This case concerns a Mississippi law that generally prohibits abortion after the fifteenth week of pregnancy. The Supreme Court has ruled that the law is constitutional, overturning the previous bright-line viability rule established by Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey. Chief Justice Roberts, concurring in the judgment, agrees that the previous rule should be discarded but takes a more measured approach, stating that the right to choose to terminate a pregnancy should extend only far enough to ensure a reasonable opportunity to choose, and not all the way to viability.  The Supreme Court has ruled that a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy extends up to the point that the fetus is regarded as viable outside the womb. This ruling overturns the previous rule from Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood, which had anchored a woman's right to abortion to viability. The new ruling is based on the principle of judicial restraint, and the Court has acknowledged that it erred in Roe in adopting viability as the earliest point at which a State may legislate to advance its interests in the area of abortion.  The United States Supreme Court has ruled that a state may not ban abortions after fifteen weeks of pregnancy, as this violates a woman's constitutional right to privacy. The Court has also ruled that the viability line is a relic of a time when the only two state interests warranting regulation of abortion were maternal health and protection of potential life.  The Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution does not protect a right to an abortion, and that states may prohibit elective abortions if a rational basis supports doing so. This ruling overturns the previous precedent set by Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood.  The Supreme Court has ruled that the right to an abortion is a constitutional right, and that this right is not dependent on the viability of the fetus.  The U.S. Supreme Court has affirmed that a woman has a right to choose to terminate a pregnancy, but has also held that this right may be overridden by the state's legitimate interests when the fetus is viable outside the womb. In this case, the Court declined to reconsider the viability rule, but left open
