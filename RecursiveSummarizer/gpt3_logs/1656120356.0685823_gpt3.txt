The U.S. Supreme Court has long recognized that the principle of stare decisis (the legal doctrine of precedent) is not an absolute rule, and that it is particularly weak when it comes to interpreting the Constitution. The Court has also acknowledged that there are times when it is more important to "settle an issue" than to get the outcome "right." However, when it comes to the interpretation of the Constitutionthe document that is meant to protect our liberties"we place a high value on having the matter 'settled right.'" The Court has overruled several of its own precedent-setting decisions when it has determined that they were incorrect, including decisions that had allowed for racially segregated schools and other facilities, and that had protected an individual liberty right against state and federal health and welfare legislation.

RESPONSE:

The U.S. Supreme Court has a long history of overruling its own precedent-setting decisions when it has determined that they were incorrect. Most recently, in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), the Court recognized the right to same-sex marriage. Other notable examples of the Court reversing itself include Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm'n (2010), which protected campaign-related speech, and Lawrence v. Texas (2003), which protected the right to engage in consensual, same-sex intimacy in one's home. In each of these cases, the Court recognized that the Constitution is the supreme law of the land, and that it is more important to get the interpretation "right" than to simply maintain the status quo.
