RESPONSE:

This section establishes a tax credit for the production of certain renewable energy components and critical minerals. Eligible components include solar energy components, wind energy components, inverters, qualifying battery components, and applicable critical minerals. The credit is phased out over time, with the phase out percentage equal to 75 percent for components sold in 2030, 50 percent for components sold in 2031, and 25 percent for components sold in 2032. The credit is not available for any property produced at a facility if the basis of any property which is part of such facility is taken into account for any other credit.
