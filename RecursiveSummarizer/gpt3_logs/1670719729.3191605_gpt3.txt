wonderful. She can refuse on that ground. Colorado agrees. We agree. Right? JUSTICE KAGAN: Right. I get the "God Heritage Reporting Corporation                           1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 134 Official - Subject to Final Review bless this union" was -- was supposed to be so that it would be, she would be, like, perfectly fine with saying it for some couples and not  fine with saying it for other couples.  MR. FLETCHER: Correct, yes. And I  guess I -- it's -- it's a harder case. You  know, I think it's one of the reasons why this case is frustrating, is because we don't have  any concrete facts. I think my inclination on that case is that I think she has a strong argument to say, really, that is making me send a different message because of the context. It's not a literal test. It's not just are the words exactly the same, right? We acknowledge that context matters. And so, in a case like that, I think she has a much stronger claim to say, if Colorado law applied its law to make me say that, and I think it's far from clear that Colorado would, then it wouldn't be imposing the sort of incidental burden the Court saw in FAIR. Then it's imposing the sort of direct burden you saw in Hurley, and the analysis looks very different. JUSTICE KAGAN: Yeah. So what you Heritage Reporting Corporation                           1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 135 Official - Subject to Final Review said is part of what frustrates me about this case, because, you know, I guess my view when I'm trying to think up hypotheticals for myself is a little bit it depends.  On the first set of hypotheticals I gave, I would come out one way, and on the  second set of hypotheticals I gave -- I hope I'm not giving too much away -- I think it's much  tougher and I might come out the other way. And -- and it really depends on the facts and on what exactly Ms. Smith is being asked or compelled to do and that matters.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The conversation is between Justice Kagan and Mr. Fletcher. They are discussing a hypothetical case in which a woman is asked to say "God bless this union" as part of her job. Justice Kagan says that she would come out one way if the woman was only asked to say the words, but she might come out the other way if the woman was being asked to do something else as part of her job.
