Extract names of budget proposals from the following text:


mayor, you know approved by city council, and then you know, because it's a department when we come back for budget hearings, they will come before the council.  This is not clear in other questions so I'm just clarifying it so that it is an appointed position, and then this council will then vote on up or down on this position.  Yes, and you know this, this department slash office, you know, it's given a department number it will be its own page, and it will come before Council budget hearing time like every other department in our book, but so why not just call it office of the environment.

When when it's ready to come before you I don't have a date for you chairman so I'd behave, but it is someone that will be appointed and approved by Council.  Okay, just like all the other thank you so much.  Alderman O'Shea do you have a point of information that
