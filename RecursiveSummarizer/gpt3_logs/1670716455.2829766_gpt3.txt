Write a concise summary of the following:


book is specific to the Midwest industry, construction costs for the items.  And the bidder can either bid the price of the book, lower or higher.  And the JOC contracts are used to respond to task orders related to the user department specific scope of work.  The value of the JOC contract depends upon the department needs and their budget.  No projects are identified at the time of bidding.  Contract is for a fixed term and has the potential dollar value, a minimum and a maximum dollar value.

And it's also asked why do they believe, the department believes is this JOC appropriate? And is there any other means or methods that the department can procure these services or goods under and work under other than JOC? So that it has to be kind of justified as to why this project is JOC appropriate.

And that documentation includes a cost proposal, as well as what is their proposed minority and women-owned business plan, compliance plan to achieve the contract goals on the contract.  And when that's done, once the department has received a cost
