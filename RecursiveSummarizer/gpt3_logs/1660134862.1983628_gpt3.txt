CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

This section of the bill delays the implementation of a rule that would have eliminated the safe harbor protection for prescription drug rebates. It also appropriates $10 million for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to carry out the provisions of the bill. Finally, it requires Medicare Part D plans to cover adult vaccines recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.
