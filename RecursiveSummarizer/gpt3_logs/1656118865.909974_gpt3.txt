DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The British Parliament made abortion a crime in 1803 at all stages of pregnancy with severe punishment. This was due in part to medical concern that fetal life should be protected by law at all stages of gestation. In the US during the 19th century, the vast majority of states enacted statutes criminalizing abortion at all stages of pregnancy. By 1868, when the 14th amendment was ratified, 28 out of 37 states had enacted statutes making abortion a crime even if it was performed before quickening. Rhode Island criminalized abortion at all stages in 1861.
