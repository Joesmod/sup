PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


just saying, are we going to put something in the ordinance and amending this ordinance to state something of the fact that if you are working in a community area and based on whatever that number is, percentages that we're trying to hit, that there are people, whether there are people that are working in a community area, whether we have so many days to get people or a timeframe or something before we're going outside the community area.  I think something needs to be there because I do agree that we have to have workers who are working for these companies, but also give opportunities for residents in the communities to get on board with some of these companies, whether it's get into the union or get a job with these companies.  So it's gotta be somewhere stipulated in there.  So I would like for us to leave this meeting saying we'll go back and find out how we can address that in this ordinance and not just that we'll look at it, but let's really go back and address it and put something in this ordinance that states that.  Okay, well, thank you for your comment.  And like I said, this is a subject matter hearing, so we can hear everyone's ideas and concerns on that.  Alderman Villegas and after Alderman Villegas, I'm going to go to some of our industry individuals and then we'll come back for additional questions.  Go ahead, Alderman Villegas.  Thank you, Chairman.  Quick question.  On this, the 25%, why was that number determined? Why not 30, 40, 50%? What is that 25% and what is that total household income indicate the 25%? 25% was selected.  It's the lowest quartile of individuals in our city.  Those are enduring some of the hardest economic circumstances.  So the lowest quartile was just used.  There's not a specific cutoff as relates to 25.  It could have been 10% or 15%, but the lowest quarter of our residents in the city is what ultimately it boiled down to.  And it wasn't something that was based on anything other than the factors that are set for, as far


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The city ordinance being discussed stipulates that a certain percentage of workers for city projects must come from the local community. Alderman Villegas asks why the number is 25%, and is told that it is the lowest quartile of income earners in the city. There is no specific cutoff for the 25%, it is just the lowest quartile.
