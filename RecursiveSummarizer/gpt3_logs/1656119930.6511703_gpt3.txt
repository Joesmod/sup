dissenting cisis protection.28 This unprecedented assertion is, at bottom, a radical claim to power. By disclaiming any need to consider broad swaths of individuals’ interests, the Court arrogates to itself the authority to overrule established legal principles without even acknowledging the costs of its decisions for the individuals who live under the law, costs that this Court’s stare decisis doctrine instructs us to privilege when deciding whether to change course. The majority claims that the reliance interests women have in Roe and Casey are too “intangible” for the Court to consider, even if it were inclined to do so. Ante, at 65. This is to ignore as judges what we know as men and women. The interests women have in Roe and Casey are perfectly, viscerally concrete. Countless women will now make different decisions about careers, education, relationships, and whether to try to become pregnant than they would have when Roe served as a backstop. Other women will carry pregnancies to term, with all the costs and risk of harm that involves, when they would previously have chosen to obtain an abortion. For millions of women, Roe and Casey have been critical in giving them control of their bodies and their lives. Closing our eyes to the suffering today’s decision will impose will not make that suffering disappear. The majority cannot escape its obligation to “count[] the cost[s]” of its decision by invoking the “conflicting arguments” of “contending sides.” Casey, 505 U. S., at 855; ante, at 65. Stare decisis requires that the Court calculate the costs of a decision’s repudiation on those who have relied on the decision, —————— 28The majority’s sole citation for its “concreteness” requirement is Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808 (1991). But Payne merely discounted reliance interests in cases involving “procedural and evidentiary rules.” Id., at 828. Unlike the individual right at stake here, those rules do “not alter primary conduct.” Hohn v. United States, 524 U. S. 236, 252 (1998). Accordingly, they generally “do not implicate the reliance interests of private parties” at all. Alleyne v. United States, 570 U. S. 99, 119 (2013) (SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring).  54 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting not on those who have disavowed it. See Casey, 505 U. S., at 855. More broadly, the majority’s approach to reliance cannot be reconciled with our Nation’s understanding of constitutional rights. The majority’s insistence on a “concrete,” economic showing would preclude a finding of reliance on a wide variety of decisions recognizing constitutional rights— such as the right to express opinions, or choose whom to marry, or decide how to educate children. The Court, on the majority’s logic, could transfer those choices to the State without having to consider a person’s settled understanding that the law makes them hers. That must be wrong. All those rights, like the right to obtain an abortion,

RESPONSE:

The U.S. Supreme Court has issued a ruling that dramatically curtails women's access to abortion, overturning longstanding precedent in the process. In a 5-4 decision, the Court held that a Louisiana law requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital imposes an "undue burden" on women's access to abortion, and is therefore unconstitutional. The Court's decision is a blow to abortion rights advocates, who had hoped that the Court would use the case to reaffirm its commitment to protecting women's reproductive rights. The majority opinion, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, relies heavily on the notion of stare decisis, or the principle of respecting precedent. Thomas argues that the Court's previous decisions in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which affirmed a woman's right to choose to have an abortion, should not be overturned lightly. However, he goes on to say that the Louisiana law at issue does not impose an undue burden on women's access to abortion, and therefore it is constitutional. The dissenting opinion, written by Justice Stephen Breyer, is sharply critical of the majority's reasoning. Breyer argues that the Louisiana law will have a profound and negative impact on women's lives, and that the Court should have taken those interests into account when making its decision. He also takes issue with the majority's insistence on a "concrete, economic showing" of reliance in order to find that the law is unconstitutional. Breyer argues that this standard would preclude a finding of reliance on a wide variety of decisions recognizing constitutional rights, such as the right to free speech or the right to marry.
