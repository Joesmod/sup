RESPONSE:

In 1869, the Territory of Wyoming enacted a law making it a crime to "administer or cause to be administered to any woman, poison, substance, or liquid, or use or cause to be used any instrument" with the intent to procure a miscarriage. The punishment for this crime was a prison sentence of not less than two years. If the woman died as a result of the abortion, the person responsible was guilty of manslaughter and could be imprisoned for not less than three years. In 1876, the Territory of Utah enacted a similar law, making it a crime to "provide, supply, or administer to any pregnant woman, or procure any such woman to take any medicine, drug, or substance, or use or employ any instrument or other means whatever, with intent thereby to procure the miscarriage of such woman" unless the abortion was necessary to save the woman's life. The punishment for this crime was a prison sentence of not less than two years. In 1877, the Territory of North Dakota enacted a law making it a crime to "administer to any pregnant woman, or who prescribes for any such woman, or advises or procures any such woman to take any medicine, drug or substance, or uses or employs any instrument or other means whatever with intent thereby to procure the miscarriage of such woman" unless the abortion was necessary to save the woman's life. The punishment for this crime was a prison sentence of not less than three years. In 1890, the Territory of Oklahoma enacted a law making it a crime to "administer to any pregnant woman, or who prescribes for any such woman, or advises or procures any such woman to take any medicine, drug or substance, or uses or employs any instrument or other means whatever, with intent thereby to procure the miscarriage of such woman" unless the abortion was necessary to save the woman's life. The punishment for this crime was a prison sentence of not less than three years. In 1899, the Territory of Alaska enacted a law making it a crime to "administer to any woman pregnant with a child any medicine, drug, or substance whatever, or shall use any instrument or other means, with intent thereby to destroy such child" unless the abortion was necessary to save the woman's life. The punishment for this crime was a prison sentence of not less than two years.
