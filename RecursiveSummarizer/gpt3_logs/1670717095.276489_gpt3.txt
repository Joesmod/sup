RESPONSE:

The City of Chicago is proposing to sell a vacant lot to Forging Opportunities for Refugees in America (FORA), an organization that provides services to refugees in the Chicago area. The sale would be a big win for FORA, as they are already located in the neighborhood and work with other local organizations. The amendment to the escrow agreement would allow FORA to excavate and dispose of contaminated woodchips on the property. Alderman Deborah Silverstein is in support of the sale and amendment, as FORA does excellent work in helping refugees navigate the language and cultural differences in the United States. There are no objections from members of the committee, and the sale is recommended for approval at the next City Council meeting.
