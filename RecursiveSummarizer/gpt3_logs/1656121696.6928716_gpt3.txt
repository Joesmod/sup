basic right. The Court contends that it is impossible to address Roes conclusion that the Constitution protects the womans right to abortion, without also addressing Roes rule that the States interests are not constitutionally adequate to justify a ban on abortion until viability. See ibid. But we have partially overruled precedents before, see, e.g., United States v. Miller, 471 U. S. 130, 142144 (1985); Daniels v. Williams, 474 U. S. 327, 328331 (1986); Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79, 9093 (1986), and certainly have never held that a distinct holding defining the contours of a constitutional right must be treated as part and parcel of the right itself. Overruling the subsidiary rule is sufficient to resolve this case in Mississippis favor. The law at issue allows abortions up through fifteen weeks, providing an adequate opportunity to exercise the right Roe protects. By the time a pregnant woman has reached that point, her pregnancy is well into the second trimester. Pregnancy tests are now inexpensive and accurate, and a woman ordinarily discovers she is pregnant by six weeks of gestation. See A. Branum & K. Ahrens, Trends in Timing of Pregnancy Awareness Among US Women, 21 Maternal & Child Health J. 715, 722    10 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment (2017). Almost all know by the end of the first trimester. Pregnancy Recognition 39. Safe and effective abortifacients, moreover, are now readily available, particularly during those early stages. See I. Adibi et al., Abortion, 22 Geo. J. Gender & L. 279, 303 (2021). Given all this, it is no surprise that the vast majority of abortions happen in the first trimester. See Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Abortion SurveillanceUnited States 1 (2020). Presumably most of the remainder would also take place earlier if later abortions were not a legal option. Ample evidence thus suggests that a 15-week ban provides sufficient time, absent rare circumstances, for a woman to decide for herself  whether to terminate her pregnancy. Webster, 492 U. S., at 520 (plurality opinion).* III Whether a precedent should be overruled is a question entirely within the discretion of the court. Hertz v. Woodman, 218 U. S. 205, 212 (1910); see also Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 828 (1991) (stare decisis is a principle of policy). In my respectful view, the sound exercise of that discretion should have led the Court to resolve the case on the narrower grounds set forth above, rather than overruling Roe and Casey entirely. The Court says there is no principled basis for this approach, ante, at 73, but in fact it is firmly grounded in basic principles of stare decisis and judicial restraint.  *The majority contends that nothing like [my approach] was recommended by either party. Ante, at 72. But as explained, Mississippi in fact pressed a similar argument in its filings before this Court. See Pet. for Cert. 1526; Brief for Petitioners

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Court has overruled precedents before, and it is within the Court's discretion to do so again. In this case, the Court has overruled Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood, concluding that a state ban on abortion after fifteen weeks is constitutional. The majority opinion argues that this ban provides sufficient time for a woman to make an informed decision about whether to terminate her pregnancy.
