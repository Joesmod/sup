Write a concise summary of the following:


department look like.  Like I said I think you know we have some work to do that it wasn't, it's not about just, you know, pulling different pieces from all the departments, but that you know this is an office starting with 10 people, I think we recognize that you know it's, it's the policy.  It's you know the Commission all the work that's going to happen in the next year that we want to get to a full blown department that I think you know all of us here have that want that and have that intention and want to get to.  So I think that's where we're trying to get to the management ordinance what you see before you kind of gets that started and makes that commitment.  I won't belabor that and if that's the strategy of the administration, again I'm not, I think, a lot of my colleagues, including my colleague to the right all them, a lot of people have spent a lot of time on this.  I'm going to do an apples apples which I mentioned the opening budget is that we had a department of housing, we got rid of the Department of Housing and then four years ago, we added one back out of thin air, and we cobbled it together it was put into the budget.  Mayor life would appointed a great Commissioner and Commissioner Navarro who built that department up over time.  During coven department of environment, did a phenomenal job of housing people in a crisis.  Everyone Department of Housing I'm sorry, Department of Housing did a phenomenal job of doing, making sure that people were housed and had rent assistance.  Department of Environment in the environment that we're in with the climate change.  Who knows what the next four years will look like.  There was no study done four years ago, or five years ago to say, we should reinstitute a Department of Environment members of the Council the administration said, this is the right thing to do.  And we did it.  And I think just, you know, why we don't do that now is kind of a head scratcher so I just, I wanted to make that point.  So thank

RESPONSE:

The administration is proposing to create a new Department of Housing and Development, and Councilmember Johnson wants to make sure that it is done right this time. He points out that the last time a housing department was created, it was done without any study or planning, and it was not successful. He wants to make sure that this new department is well-funded and staffed so that it can be successful in its mission.
