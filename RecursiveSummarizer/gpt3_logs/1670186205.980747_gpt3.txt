Write a concise summary of the following:


that I've complained about not getting things done right like things are not flowing.  Whether it at PVC where in some of these other areas where they're waiting for projects and nothing's happening.  So I'm not sure if it's a procurement I know it's not the funding funding is there.  So I don't know if it's the procurement or just the fact that you have a flow of bureaucracy of why we're failing to sort of meet that that moment.  So we like a little more information on that.

But at some point, this has to be a pivot to that environmental office because climate change is not going away we've committed to it.  We put it in our in our in our mission statement.
