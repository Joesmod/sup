Write a concise summary of the following:


the federal DBE approach.  If people can come in on an individual basis and demonstrate that they are suffering discriminatory barriers that they'll certify the program.  So that's another possible approach.  I'm sorry.  So that might be a little bit more than you wanted to hear.  No, no, I fully appreciate that.  Sorry, I did just super one more thing.  And sorry, Chair.  You mentioned potentially, or that you, there was a recommendation of creating a group to make sure that the directors are kind of executed on that would be part of, you know, the department.  Is there a budget amount to what that would look like? Not that I know of.  I think the idea I had, at least we all thought was really just a group of people who would be willing to come together maybe once a month for a while and advise the city, talk through it, kind of be a voice of the contracting community.  So I don't know that there's really a budget implication for that people were happy to volunteer their time because they were so happy anybody was talking to them that they wanted to keep talking to somebody.  And that isn't me, but they wanted to keep talking to the city.  God, I fully understand.  Thank you so much for all that.  And thank you, Chair.  Thank you so much.  I'm in best class.  Next person is Alderman Byron Cinco Lopez.  Thank you.  Thank you, Chairman.  And thank you, Ms.  Collette.  It's very good to meet you.  Just following up a little bit on the question that my colleague Vasquez mentioned about some of the outdated mandates that we have.  And again, there's not much we can do with the federal mandates.  I think that there's something in a growing conversation, at least at this point.  But in terms of the requirements that we have, the 26 and 6%, I mean, we're talking about numbers that go back to the 80s.  A lot has happened since then.  I think that we have different demographics in the city.  There's different needs.  There's different inequities that have maintained over


CONCISE SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

The federal DBE approach allows people to come in on an individual basis and demonstrate that they are suffering discriminatory barriers. If they can do this, the program will certify them. This is another possible approach that may be more effective than the current system.
