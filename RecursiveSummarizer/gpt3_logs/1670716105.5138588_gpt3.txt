Write a concise summary of the following:


like folks in this room to identify the best governance structure possible.  So that's the goal of the study, you know, and that's interesting because my first thought is six months to do a study I was like, this is going to procurement forget about that.  So it sounds like it's going to be a pro bono study through CCA is what I'm hearing.  What's the accountability.  Then if there's no contract that there's no procurement process with the sense to get that done in six months.  It is my understanding that it through this language and please Susie or a verify this that we will be taking the recommendations back to you all for review.  Does that answer the question.  I'm curious about what's the accountability to get this done in six months, right in the projected timeline that stated here, I know it says states shall is that, is that what we're leaning on or, I mean, you know, I'll add to what Angela said I think the accountability is important for ourselves, is that we will have this done and bring it back through the committees to talk about that and have that conversation of you know where the study lands what it tells us if it was, you know, if there's more that we need to look at but we did put a date in there to keep ourselves accountable to make sure that we hit that date and bring that before you.  I guess you've heard it from a lot of us that, you know, I think you should have done this, a while ago and you know I think we could have taken it even step further with the change of a couple words and with more staffing.  We could have done it quickly.  Real quick last question, I don't know if this is appropriate this point just wanted to talk about the appropriation for the female appropriation for reimbursements or, you know, funding for asylum seekers.  Yeah, my understanding is nonprofits have been a part of the process and and and have submitted budgeting for for reimbursements, I just want to be on the record that that's the case.  And if you can give us


CONCISE SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

The goal of the study is to identify the best possible governance structure. It is interesting because it is a pro bono study through CCA. The accountability is that there is a date set to keep the study on track and to bring it before the committees. The last question was about funding for asylum seekers and whether or not nonprofits have submitted budgeting for reimbursements.
