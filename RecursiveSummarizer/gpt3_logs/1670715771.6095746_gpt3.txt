they are not for profit entities that have huge corporate level funded salaries for their top end employees, and as well oftentimes take up to 15% off the top of everything that we give them to provide services in the neighborhoods for their own administrative purposes.  So it's not without the scope of acceptable questions to ask how much we've been providing them and why they are getting property for free, or they're only required to stay committed to a community for 10 years even though they will continue to own that property, hence forth, until they decide to sell it.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Although wags back waggers back.  Thanks, Chairman.  Just, you know, I just took a quick look at the agreement that we signed back in 2020.

RESPONSE:

The City of Chicago has leased a property to a nonprofit organization for 10 years.
