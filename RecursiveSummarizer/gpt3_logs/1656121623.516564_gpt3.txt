HEALTH, ET AL., PETITIONERS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION, ET AL. ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT [June 24, 2022] JUSTICE THOMAS, concurring. I join the opinion of the Court because it correctly holds that there is no constitutional right to abortion. Respondents invoke one source for that right: the Fourteenth Amendments guarantee that no State shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. The Court well explains why, under our substantive due process precedents, the purported right to abortion is not a form of liberty protected by the Due Process Clause. Such a right is neither deeply rooted in this Nations history and tradition nor implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 721 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). [T]he idea that the Framers of the Fourteenth Amendment understood the Due Process Clause to protect a right to abortion is farcical. June Medical Services L. L. C. v. Russo, 591 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (THOMAS, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 17). I write separately to emphasize a second, more fundamental reason why there is no abortion guarantee lurking in the Due Process Clause. Considerable historical evidence indicates that due process of law merely required executive and judicial actors to comply with legislative enactments and the common law when depriving a person of    2 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION THOMAS, J., concurring life, liberty, or property. See, e.g., Johnson v. United States, 576 U. S. 591, 623 (2015) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment). Other sources, by contrast, suggest that due process of law prohibited legislatures from authorizing the deprivation of a persons life, liberty, or property without providing him the customary procedures to which freemen were entitled by the old law of England. United States v. Vaello Madero, 596 U. S. ___, ____ (2022) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3) (internal quotation marks omitted). Either way, the Due Process Clause at most guarantees process. It does not, as the Courts substantive due process cases suppose, forbi[d] the government to infringe certain fundamental liberty interests at all, no matter what process is provided. Reno v. Flores, 507 U. S. 292, 302 (1993); see also, e.g., Collins v. Harker Heights, 503 U. S. 115, 125 (1992). As I have previously explained, substantive due process is an oxymoron that lack[s] any basis in the Constitution. Johnson, 576 U. S., at 607608 (opinion of THOMAS, J.); see also, e.g., Vaello Madero, 596 U. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3) ([T]ext and history provide little support for modern substantive due process doctrine). The notion that a constitutional provision that guarantees only process before a person is deprived of life, liberty, or property could define the substance of those rights strains credulity for even the

CONCISE SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

The Court holds that there is no constitutional right to abortion. The Due Process Clause at most guarantees process, and does not protect any fundamental liberty interests. This is an oxymoron that lack[s] any basis in the Constitution.
