Write a concise summary of the following:

anyone who attempts to procure a miscarriage in any way, including through prescribing drugs or using instruments. If the woman or her child dies as a result of the attempt, the offender will be imprisoned for at least three years.  The Court holds that there is no constitutional right to abortion. The Due Process Clause at most guarantees process, and does not protect any fundamental liberty interests. This is an oxymoron that lack[s] any basis in the Constitution.  The Court today declined to overturn its previous rulings on abortion, which are based on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. However, Justice Thomas, in a concurring opinion, called for the Court to reconsider all of its previous rulings on substantive due process, including those involving abortion. He argued that these rulings are based on an erroneous interpretation of the Due Process Clause and that other constitutional provisions may provide protections for the rights announced in these cases.  In Timbs v. Indiana, the Supreme Court held that the Eighth Amendment's excessive fines clause is incorporated against the states by the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. Justice Thomas wrote a concurring opinion, in which he argued that the Court should have gone further and held that the doctrine of substantive due process is unconstitutional. Substantive due process allows courts to strike down laws that they believe violate unenumerated rights, such as the right to abortion that the Court has recognized. This approach exalts judges at the expense of the People and allows them to strike down laws that they disagree with on policy grounds.  The liberty supporting the abortion right has shifted yet again, with three different interests being proposed that supposedly spring from the Due Process Clause. These include bodily integrity, personal autonomy in matters of family, medical care, and faith, and womens equal citizenship. However, after 50 years since Roe, abortion advocates still cannot coherently articulate the right (or rights) at stake, proving that the right to abortion is ultimately a policy goal in desperate search of a constitutional justification.  The Court overrules Roe and Casey, two previous decisions that found a constitutional right to abortion. The harm caused by these decisions is immeasurable, according to Thomas. He argues that the Court should follow the text of the Constitution in future cases, which sets forth certain substantive rights that cannot be taken away. Kavanaugh concurs, writing separately to explain his view that Roe was wrongly decided and should be overruled.  The Court today ruled that the Constitution is neutral on the issue of abortion, and that it is up to the people and their elected representatives to resolve the issue through the democratic process.  The Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution does not outlaw or legalize abortion, but leaves the question to be decided by the people through the democratic
