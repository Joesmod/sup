Write a detailed summary of the following:

a dramatic impact on women's ability to control their own reproductive lives, and it is sure to be met with fierce opposition from reproductive rights advocates.  The Roe vs. Wade decision was a landmark moment in Supreme Court history, and one that has been heavily debated ever since. The decision was based on the right to privacy, and the belief that a woman's body is her own to control. The decision has been upheld in subsequent cases, but the current Court has now overturned it. The majority opinion argues that the decision was wrongly decided, and that it is up to the states to decide whether or not to allow abortions. The dissent argues that the decision was correctly decided, and that it is a woman's right to control her own body.  In the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of a Mississippi law that would ban abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The Court struck down the law by a 7-to-2 vote, holding that in the earlier stages of pregnancy, the choice of whether or not to have an abortion must belong to the woman, in consultation with her family and doctor. The Court explained that a long line of precedents, including the right to privacy, protected individual decisionmaking related to abortion. The Court also recognized the valid interests of the state in regulating abortion, such as protecting potential life, maintaining medical standards, and safeguarding the health of the woman. However, the Court held that these interests must yield to the woman's right to choose in the first trimester of pregnancy. After the first trimester, the state may regulate to protect the woman's health, and after viability, the state may ban abortion except when necessary to preserve the woman's life or health.  In the 1992 case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the constitutional right to abortion established in Roe v. Wade. The Court held that this right was grounded in the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of liberty, and that the state could not place undue restrictions on this right. Casey also recognized the importance of the right to contraception, which the Court had previously established in a series of cases. In reaffirming Roe, the Court took into account the diversity of views on abortion, and the competing state interests at stake.  The Supreme Court's decision in Casey v. Planned Parenthood struck a balance between a woman's right to choose an abortion and a state's interest in protecting potential life. The Court held that a state could not place an "undue burden" on a woman seeking an abortion prior to viability, but could regulate abortion to protect the woman's health and to promote prenatal life. Casey also reaffirmed Roe v. Wade's holding that a state could not bar abortion after viability.  The Supreme Court has ruled that there is no nationwide right to abortion, overturning decades of precedent. The ruling will allow states to ban abortion
