RESPONSE:

The Solar Energy Component Tax Credit is a tax credit for solar energy components used in residential or commercial solar energy systems. The credit is for up to 30% of the cost of the solar energy components, and is capped at $2000 for residential systems and $50,000 for commercial systems. The credit is available for solar modules, photovoltaic cells, photovoltaic wafers, solar grade polysilicon, torque tubes or structural fasteners, and polymeric backsheets.
