administration.  I can't speak for the AIS Commissioner, but I think if your question is around funding for our public facilities.  We do have funding for, you know, upgrading and improving our, our facilities and that is part of our continuous cycle of you know improvements maintenance of our city facilities.  So that money is is budgeted in the capital plan.  And just to the social programming of it I know that we, we have a lot of agencies, you know, we have CPS.  I am just really concerned about the level of coordination that we have, especially when it comes to young people.  What is the response that maybe we have CD pH here, we have a national crisis in terms of youth, especially youth mental health.  What is the allocation or the proper allocation to address these I think I'm really concerned about the level of violence that is affecting young people, how we created more activities more spaces more infrastructure but as well as more programming, how we're doing these in between agencies, excuse me, Alderman we're not revisiting the budget hearings again.  That was, you know, the Department of Public Health was here.  And I think that was a opportunity to ask coordination questions then.  So if you have a question on any of the amendments managed, which is, which is not part CPS and the park district, CTA and not part of this amendment here.  I would ask that you go to your next question.  Yeah, my next question then very clear right, I think that when it comes to looking at our facilities and all that the mental health is a huge issue.  How do we repurpose facilities because when it comes down to spaces.  You know, I think that there's a lot of opportunity there and the management, again goes back to efficiency, you know, where you know what is the level of commitment to be able to provide these services to young people who are in dire need.  Let me rephrase that question.  I appreciate the feedback and I think that's something we could definitely look at
