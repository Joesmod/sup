CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The average non-Federal manufacturer price for a drug will be increased by the percentage increase in the consumer price index from the year prior to the year of the drug's publication date. The plan specific enrollment weighted amount for a prescription drug plan or an MAPD plan will be the negotiated price of the drug for the most recent year, multiplied by the total number of individuals enrolled in the plan divided by the total number of individuals enrolled in a prescription drug plan or an MAPD plan.
