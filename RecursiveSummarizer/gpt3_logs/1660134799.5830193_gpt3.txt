RESPONSE:

The "specified drug" for a given manufacturer is defined as an applicable drug produced, prepared, propagated, compounded, converted, or processed by that manufacturer. For the purposes of this section, all persons treated as a single employer under subsection (a) or (b) of section 52 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall be treated as one manufacturer. A manufacturer described in this clause shall not be considered a "specified manufacturer" if such manufacturer is acquired after 2021 by another manufacturer that is not a specified manufacturer. The "specified LIS percent" is the percentage of applicable drugs dispensed to low-income subsidy (LIS) beneficiaries that are produced by specified manufacturers.
