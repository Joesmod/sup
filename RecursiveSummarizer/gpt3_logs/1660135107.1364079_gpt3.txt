RESPONSE:

The "product identification number requirement" stipulates that, in order to be eligible for the tax credit under section 25C of the Internal Revenue Code, an item of specified property must be produced by a qualified manufacturer and the taxpayer must include the qualified product identification number of such item on their tax return. A qualified product identification number is a unique number assigned to an item of specified property by the qualified manufacturer pursuant to a methodology approved by the Internal Revenue Service. A qualified manufacturer is a manufacturer of specified property who enters into an agreement with the IRS which provides that the manufacturer will assign a product identification number to each item of specified property produced, label such item with the number, and make periodic written reports to the IRS.
