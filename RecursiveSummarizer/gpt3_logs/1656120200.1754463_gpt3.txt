In the present case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the Court is asked to consider whether a state law banning abortion after 15 weeks' gestation is constitutional.

The Court left open the possibility that the right is rooted in the First, Fourth, or Fifth Amendment, or in some combination of those provisions, and that this right has been "incorporated" into the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court also left open the possibility that the right is simply a component of the "liberty" protected by the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. In Casey v.

The Court did not address the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which some amici have now offered as another potential home for the abortion right.

RESPONSE:

The Dobbs case challenges a state law that bans abortion after 15 weeks' gestation. The Supreme Court is being asked to consider whether this law is constitutional, and the outcome of the case could have a significant impact on the availability of abortion in the United States. The Supreme Court has previously ruled on the constitutionality of abortion in the 1973 case of Roe v. Wade. In that case, the Court held that the Constitution protects a woman's right to have an abortion. In the 1992 case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Court reaffirmed Roe's "central holding" that a woman has a right to have an abortion, but left open the possibility that states could place restrictions on abortion so long as those restrictions do not place an "undue burden" on the woman's right to have an abortion. In the present case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the Court is being asked to consider whether a state law banning abortion after 15 weeks' gestation is constitutional. The Court will likely rule that the state law is unconstitutional because it places an undue burden on the woman's right to have an abortion. The right to abortion has been found to spring from five different constitutional provisions: the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments. The Court has left open the possibility that the right is rooted in the First, Fourth, or Fifth Amendment, or in some combination of those provisions, and that this right has been "incorporated" into the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court has also left open the possibility that the right is simply a component of the "liberty" protected by the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. In the United States, the Supreme Court has long held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects two categories of substantive rights. The first consists of rights guaranteed by the first eight Amendments. Those Amendments originally applied only to the Federal Government, but this Court has held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the great majority of those rights and thus makes them equally applicable to the States. The second category, which is the one in question here, comprises a select list of fundamental rights that are not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution. In deciding whether a right falls into either of these categories, the Court has long asked whether the right is deeply rooted in [our] history and
