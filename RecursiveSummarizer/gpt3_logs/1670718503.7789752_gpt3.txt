PROMPT:

Write an explanation of the following and how it is a waste of the City's money:


couple things going there.  I mean, we have to remember that, you know, beginning of the year we were still underground living in our homes and so by the time we hit second quarter it wasn't much later and our willingness to go outside and go to work and come to meetings like this for the first time we're going to be able to go through the same struggles and so what we're seeing is a lot of our implementation not profit struggle with the same staffing hiring issues that we have and people's willingness to go in people's homes are the same struggles.  So this year has definitely been a year of surprises as it gets to how do we leverage our existing infrastructure because it's been falling everywhere frankly and so my excitement is really for next year.  We've got a tremendous amount of resources coming through CRP for on-rock and repairs and resources for the home repair program.  It's really a matter of how do we find the vendors and contractors and GECs to start doing that work and as we build capacity, you know, thinking about home ownership, you know, we need to give people access to credit so they can go pay people to do those jobs and so it's really building that infrastructure so I'm very thankful that the mayor's office and everyone has been very flexible about figuring that out and so I think next year with the alderman support and everyone supports who are the vendors in your community, who are the people that can be GCs and how do we acknowledge that we don't have one GC that's doing 600 jobs for us anymore? We need like 10 GCs that do 50 or 60 jobs and so how do I get a handful of black and brown GCs that can run crews to build porches, to build roads, to go fix things fairly quickly? This is a great time to start plugging people in so NHS and Elevate have the beginning, they're the beginnings of our contracts but it's really how to expand that greater and beyond.  That's a really fascinating challenge.  I may have to circle back with you on that.  Two


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The City is wasting money by not leveraging its existing infrastructure and not hiring black and brown contractors to do work.
