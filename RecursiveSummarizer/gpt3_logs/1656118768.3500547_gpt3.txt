weeks.” §4(b).14 To support this Act, the legislature made a series of factual findings. It began by noting that, at the time of enactment, only six countries besides the United States “permit[ted] nontherapeutic or elective abortion-on-demand after the twentieth week of gestation.”15 §2(a). The legisla- —————— 14The Act defines “gestational age” to be “the age of an unborn human being as calculated from the first day of the last menstrual period of the pregnant woman.” §3(f ). 15Those other six countries were Canada, China, the Netherlands,   Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 7 Opinion of the Court ture then found that at 5 or 6 weeks’ gestational age an “unborn human being’s heart begins beating”; at 8 weeks the “unborn human being begins to move about in the womb”; at 9 weeks “all basic physiological functions are present”; at 10 weeks “vital organs begin to function,” and “[h]air, fingernails, and toenails . . . begin to form”; at 11 weeks “an unborn human being’s diaphragm is developing,” and he or she may “move about freely in the womb”; and at 12 weeks the “unborn human being” has “taken on ‘the human form’ in all relevant respects.” §2(b)(i) (quoting Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U. S. 124, 160 (2007)). It found that most abortions after 15 weeks employ “dilation and evacuation procedures which involve the use of surgical instruments to crush and tear the unborn child,” and it concluded that the “intentional commitment of such acts for nontherapeutic or elective reasons is a barbaric practice, dangerous for the maternal patient, and demeaning to the medical profession.” §2(b)(i)(8).

DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that the Act was constitutional. The Court of Appeals reasoned that this Court’s decisions establishing a right to abortion were based on the premise that the fetus is not a “person” within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. See, e.g., Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, 153 (1973). But, the Court of Appeals continued, if the fetus is a person, as the legislature had found, then the State has a “compelling interest in forbidding elective abortions after the point at which the unborn child is capable of feeling pain.” 791 F. 3d, at 540. The Court of Appeals therefore upheld the Act’s ban on abortions after 15 weeks’ gestation, as well as its requirement that, after that point, abortions be performed in a manner that gives the unborn child the best chance of being born alive. In this case, the Supreme Court of the United States is being asked to decide whether the Mississippi Gestational Age Act violates the Constitution. The Act bans abortions after 15 weeks of gestation, with the exception of cases of medical emergency or severe fetal abnormality. It also requires that, after that point, abortions be performed in a manner that gives the unborn child the best chance of being born alive. The Supreme Court has previously recognized a constitutional right to abortion, but that right has been based on the premise that the fetus is not a "person" within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. If the fetus is a person, as the Mississippi legislature has found, then the State has a compelling interest in forbidding elective abortions after the point at which the unborn child is capable of feeling pain. The Court of Appeals upheld the Act, but the Supreme Court has now agreed to hear the case. It is unclear how the Court will rule, but the outcome could have a significant impact on the availability of abortion in the United States.
