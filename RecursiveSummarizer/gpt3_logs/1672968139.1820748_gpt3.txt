over the next couple of years and we're looking both to deepen the investments in the communities where the pilot is functioning for example right now we're in conversations.  It's not just CD pH it's CFD.  It's OEMC it's CPD, looking at adding second shift, for example, we're also looking to expand geographically based based Commissioner if I can just specifically for 2023.

It will be used, again across departments to add second shifts to add a substance use focused alternate response on the west side, and then to add some additional care responses in the areas that have the highest on met needs.

The next group that is being added is on the west side with the substance use focus team.  So how many teams is that three, there are three teams operational right now.  So three teams, and how many hours do the teams work.  So we're just working one shift right now, which is how many hours, approximately eight hours, eight hours.

And that is already in the works and being planned.  Then the next thing that will be happening will be together we're looking at both adding second shifts.  There are union negotiations and other things that go
