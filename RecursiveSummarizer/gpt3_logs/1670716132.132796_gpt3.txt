Write a concise summary of the following:


out of the mayor's office it is its own department number it's a standalone office, you know, come before Council, you know we've put in the management ordinance that we are coming with the results of the study.  There will be internal and external engagement and I fully expect that you know everyone in this office will be briefing Council regularly.  So that is the intention.  Thank you so no.  So now, next question so this is a separate office.  Yes, it is.  Is this a position, especially the sustainability officers in an appointed position, it said, is it just a management position that it just an appointed position by the mayor, you know approved by city council, and then you know, because it's a department when we come back for budget hearings, they will come before the council.  This is not clear in other questions so I'm just clarifying it so that it is an appointed position, and then this council will then vote on up or down on this position.  Yes, and you know this, this department slash office, you know, it's given a department number it will be its own page, and it will come before Council budget hearing time like every other department in our book, but so why not just call it office of the environment.  What's what's wrong with that.  So we're starting with this office, I think you know a lot of the work, and I know a lot of the conversation I've had with many of us is that we're leading to a more robust department, it's starting with this 10 person office.  I think by the time we get to the 2024 budget recommendation.  The goal of what we said in the management ordinance is that we will come before Council with the results of the study, and what a robust department, which is what we'll move into with non personnel lines and you know everything that goes into a full department, and all the different pieces that I know everyone's been talking about.  And that's where we hope to get to for 2024.  Again, I really I think that should be office of maybe

RESPONSE:

The Office of Sustainability is a new, standalone office that will be responsible for environmental initiatives in the city. The office will be headed by a sustainability officer, who will be appointed by the mayor and approved by the city council. The office will have a budget and will come before the council for budget hearings like other city departments. The goal is to eventually expand the office into a full-fledged department.
