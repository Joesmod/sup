RESPONSE:

The Roe v. Wade decision by the US Supreme Court in 1973 has been widely criticized due to the lack of grounding in the constitutional text, history, or precedent. The Court announced a detailed set of rules for abortion, dividing pregnancy into three trimesters and imposing special rules for each. During the first trimester, the Court said that the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman's attending physician. After that point, a state's interest in regulating abortion for the sake of a woman's health became compelling, and accordingly, a state could "regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health." Finally, in "the stage subsequent to viability," which in 1973 roughly coincided with the beginning of the third trimester, the state's interest in "the potentiality of human life" became compelling, and therefore a state could "regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother." The Court's opinion was criticized for its lack of explanation of how these rules could be derived from any of the sources on which constitutional decisions are usually based. In addition, the opinion was silent on the question of whether states could protect fetal life prior to viability, an issue that was not raised by any party to the case. The most important historical fact - how the States regulated abortion when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted - was not given much attention by the Court. It allowed that States had tightened their abortion laws "in the middle and late 19th century," but it implied that these laws might have been enacted not to protect fetal life but to further "a Victorian social concern" about "illicit sexual conduct." Roe's failure even to note the overwhelming consensus of state laws in effect in 1868 is striking. The Court also erroneously suggested - contrary to Bracton, Coke, Hale, Blackstone, and a wealth of other authority - that the common law had probably never really treated post-quickening abortion as a crime. This erroneous understanding appears to have played an important part in the Court's thinking because the opinion cited "the lenity of the common law" as one of the four factors that informed its decision.
