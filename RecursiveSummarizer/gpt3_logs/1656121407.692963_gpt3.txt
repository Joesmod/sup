CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The quickening distinction was a rule of common law that held that abortions and miscarriages could only be punished if they occurred after the point of quickening, or when the fetus became animate. In 1803, the British Parliament made abortion a crime at all stages of pregnancy, and this law was adopted by many states in the US by 1868. The quickening distinction was thus no longer valid by the time the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified.
