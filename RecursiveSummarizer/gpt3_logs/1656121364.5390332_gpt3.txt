CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Gestational Age Act was enacted in Mississippi to outlaw abortions after 20 weeks of gestation. The legislature made a series of factual findings to support the Act, including that at the time of enactment, only six countries besides the United States permit[ted] nontherapeutic or elective abortion-on-demand after the twentieth week of gestation. The Act was immediately challenged in court by an abortion clinic and one of its doctors, who claimed that it violated this Court's precedents establishing a constitutional right to abortion. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the respondents and permanently enjoined enforcement of the Act.
