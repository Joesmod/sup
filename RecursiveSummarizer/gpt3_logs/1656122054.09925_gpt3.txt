Write a concise summary of the following:

the sentiments of 1868 alone do not and cannot rule the present.  The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that a right to use and gain access to contraception is part of the Fourteenth Amendments guarantee of liberty. This right to contraception is of the same character as the right to abortion, and the Court has ruled that no state can deprive a woman of her right to abortion.  The Thomas concurrence makes clear that he is not on board with the majority opinion. He states that nothing in today's opinion casts doubt on non-abortion precedents, and that he only means that they are not at issue. He also notes that the author of the majority opinion recently joined a statement written by another member of the majority, lamenting that Obergefell deprived States of the ability to resolve the question of same-sex marriage through legislation.  The Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution does not protect a woman's right to choose an abortion, and that abortion bans are therefore constitutionally mandated. This decision overturns a number of previous decisions, including those recognizing the rights to same-sex intimacy and marriage, to marry across racial lines, and to use contraception. The Court's decision is based on the idea that the law in the 19th century did not protect a woman's right to choose an abortion, and that this right therefore does not implicate liberty. However, the Court's reasoning provides no way to distinguish between the right to choose an abortion and other rights, including those recognized in previous decisions. As a result, the Court's decision threatens a number of other constitutional rights.  In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court has ruled that states can ban same-sex marriage. This decision overturns the 2015 ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, which had legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. The majority opinion, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, argues that the Constitution does not protect a right to same-sex marriage, and that this issue should be left to the states. Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan wrote a dissenting opinion, arguing that the majority's decision is "catastrophic" and that it will lead to further discrimination against LGBTQ people.  The majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization strips women of agency over their bodies, overruling Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood in the process. This decision goes against the principle of stare decisis, which is central to the rule of law, and takes away a woman's liberty. The dissenters would uphold Roe and Casey, and keep women's reproductive rights intact.  The Court must have a good reason to overrule an earlier decision, and the majority today does not have a good reason to overrule Roe and Casey. The point of a right is to shield individual actions and decisions from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal
