Write a detailed summary of the following:

abortion at all,” post, at 7, and would hold only that if the Constitution protects any such right, the right ends once women have had “a reasonable opportunity” to obtain an abortion, post, at 1. The concurrence does not specify what period of time is sufficient to provide such an opportunity, but it would hold that 15 weeks, the period allowed under Mississippi’s law, is enough—at least “absent rare circumstances.” Post, at 2, 10. There are serious problems with this approach, and it is revealing that nothing like it was recommended by either party. As we have recounted, both parties and the Solicitor General have urged us either to reaffirm or overrule Roe and Casey. See supra, at 4–5. And when the specific approach advanced by the concurrence was broached at oral argument, both respondents and the Solicitor General emphatically rejected it. Respondents’ counsel termed it “completely unworkable” and “less principled and less workable than viability.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 54. The Solicitor General argued that abandoning the viability line would leave courts and others with “no continued guidance.” Id., at 101. What is more, the concurrence has not identified any of the Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 73 Opinion of the Court more than 130 amicus briefs filed in this case that advocated its approach. The concurrence would do exactly what it criticizes Roe for doing: pulling “out of thin air” a test that “[n]o party or amicus asked the Court to adopt.” Post, at 3. 2 The concurrence’s most fundamental defect is its failure to offer any principled basis for its approach. The concurrence would “discar[d]” “the rule from Roe and Casey that a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy extends up to the point that the fetus is regarded as ‘viable’ outside the womb.” Post, at 2. But this rule was a critical component of the holdings in Roe and Casey, and stare decisis is “a doctrine of preservation, not transformation,” Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm’n, 558 U. S. 310, 384 (2010) (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring). Therefore, a new rule that discards the viability rule cannot be defended on stare decisis grounds. The concurrence concedes that its approach would “not be available” if “the rationale of Roe and Casey were inextricably entangled with and dependent upon the viability standard.” Post, at 7. But the concurrence asserts that the viability line is separable from the constitutional right they recognized, and can therefore be “discarded” without disturbing any past precedent. Post, at 7–8. That is simply incorrect. Roe’s trimester rule was expressly tied to viability, see 410 U. S., at 163–164, and viability played a critical role in later abortion decisions. For example, in Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52, the Court reiterated Roe’s rule that a “State may regulate an abortion to protect the life of the fetus and even may proscribe abortion” at “the stage subsequent to viability.” 428 U. S., at 61 (emphasis added). The Court

DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Court is considering whether to overturn or reaffirm Roe v. Wade, the case that established a woman's right to abortion. The majority opinion, written by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, finds that Roe was wrongly decided and should be overturned. The concurrence, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, agrees that Roe was wrongly decided but would not overturn it outright. Instead, the concurrence would hold that the right to abortion ends once women have had "a reasonable opportunity" to obtain one. The majority opinion criticizes the concurrence for its failure to offer any principled basis for its approach. The concurrence concedes that its approach would "not be available" if the rationale of Roe and Casey were inextricably linked to the viability standard. The majority opinion also criticizes the concurrence for its assertion that the viability line is separable from the constitutional right they recognized. The majority opinion finds that the concurrence's approach is unworkable and would do nothing to provide guidance to courts or others. The majority opinion then turns to its own analysis. The majority opinion finds that Roe was wrongly decided and should be overturned. The majority opinion would return the decision of whether to legalize abortion to the states. The majority opinion finds that the Constitution does not protect a woman's right to abortion. The majority opinion also finds that the concurrence's approach is unworkable and would do nothing to provide guidance to courts or others.
