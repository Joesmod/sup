bring more context yeah uh...  i i actually did not scheduled the the meeting within this particular hearings and this committee so in terms of real estate so the sewage uh...  the wastewater tree surveillance program uh...  samples uh...  samples of of sewage in manholes that are in residential areas across the city so i believe that is the connection here under the real estate part of housing real i'll take it thank you chair all the doubt scum good morning just uh...  i've read recently that the numbers are going up on the extent to which you find stars or coven nineteen waters that accurate and then uh...  happens after you make those findings what what's the treatment yes of the the wastewater surveillance program is intended to be a piece of kind of the bigger puzzle in terms of all of our surveillance activities and one of the benefits of doing as wastewater surveillance program is that it allows us to detect increases in viral concentration in the water of infectious diseases that you wouldn't necessarily notice from just let testing for coven at uh...  primary care physician or at a hospital it the wastewater surveillance program doesn't rely on testing behaviors from community from community members so it does allow us to have an early signal potential increases in viral concentration in the water which could potentially predict increases in case counts and hospitalizations across the city our current the current viral concentration levels in the community are kind of rated at a medium level uh...  they they have fluctuated in the past and given that we are in uh...  flu season we are seeing an increase uh...  over the last couple of weeks and we are closely monitoring the situation to be able to kind of to plan our response to these potential increasing cases he said there's nothing uh...  special in the treatment of the wastewater as it goes to the metropolitan what reclamation district correct so we simply just collect the water sample uh...  and we


CONCISE SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

The City of Chicago spends money on a wastewater surveillance program that samples sewage in manholes in residential areas. The purpose of the program is to detect increases in viral concentration in the water of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. However, the program does not rely on testing behaviors from community members, so it is not an effective way to track the spread of the disease.
