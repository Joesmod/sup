damaging to the rule of law. Finally, there are no concrete reliance interests that would be harmed by overturning Casey, and indeed, many would benefit from a return to the clear and predictable legal landscape that existed prior to Casey.  The Court in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization held that Mississippi's Gestational Age Act, which bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, is constitutional. The Court applied rational basis review, under which a law is constitutional if there is a rational basis on which the legislature could have thought that it would serve legitimate state interests. The Court found that the Mississippi Legislature's specific findings, which include the State's asserted interest in "protecting the life of the unborn," provide a rational basis for the Gestational Age Act.  The Supreme Court has overturned two previous decisions that had granted women the right to have an abortion. The Court ruled that the Constitution does not prohibit states from regulating or prohibiting abortion. This ruling returns the authority to regulate abortion to the people and their elected representatives. Justices Thomas and Kavanaugh filed concurring opinions. Chief Justice Roberts filed an opinion concurring in the judgment. Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan filed a dissenting opinion.  In Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court struck down state laws prohibiting abortion, ruling that a woman's right to an abortion is protected by the Constitution. In the years since Roe, the Court has revisited the issue several times, but has largely upheld the decision. In Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, the Court ruled that Roe's "central holding" - that a state may not constitutionally protect fetal life before "viability" - must be followed even if the decision was wrong. This ruling has been controversial, with many people arguing that it represents an exercise of raw judicial power.  In the early 1990s, the Supreme Court of the United States was divided on the issue of abortion. The Court had previously ruled in Roe v. Wade that abortion was a constitutional right, but some justices wanted to overturn that decision. In 1992, the Court considered a case called Planned Parenthood v. Casey. The Court majority in Casey threw out Roes trimester scheme and replaced it with a new rule under which states could not adopt any regulation that imposed an undue burden on a womans right to have an abortion. The decision provided no clear guidance about the difference between a due and an undue burden. The three justices who authored the controlling opinion in Casey said that the Courts decision was the final settlement of the question of the constitutional right to abortion.

RESPONSE:

In 1992, the Supreme Court of the United States considered the case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey. The Court majority in Casey threw out Roe v. Wade's trimester scheme and replaced it with a new rule under which states could not adopt any regulation that imposed an undue burden on a woman's right to have an abortion. The decision provided no clear guidance about the difference between a due and an undue burden. The three justices who authored the controlling opinion in Casey said that the Court's decision was the final settlement of the question of the constitutional right to abortion. However, in the years since Casey was decided, it has become increasingly apparent that the decision did not settle the issue of abortion. Americans continue to hold passionate and widely divergent views on abortion, and state legislatures have passed laws that are increasingly restrictive. In Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the Court applied rational basis review, under which a law is constitutional if there is a rational basis on which the legislature could have thought that it would serve legitimate state interests. The Court found that the Mississippi Legislature's specific findings, which include the State's asserted interest in "protecting the life of the unborn," provide a rational basis for the Gestational Age Act. Justices Thomas and Kavanaugh filed concurring opinions. Chief Justice Roberts filed an opinion concurring in the judgment. Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan filed a dissenting opinion.
