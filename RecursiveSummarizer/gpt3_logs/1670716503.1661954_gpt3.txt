opportunities and long-term employment retention.  So 25% of the labor hours must go to a Section 3 business or persons.  And then 5% are targeted Section 3.  That is, a targeted Section 3 worker is a resident in public housing or voucher programs, a youth-filled participant, or employed by a Section 3 business.  So next slide.  So Section 3 worker, again, is a low or very low income individual earning less than $52,000 a year.  Youth-built participant or employed by a Section 3 business.  And a Section 3 business concern is greater than 51% owned or controlled by a low or very low income persons, or a business where 75% of the labor hours performed are by low or very low income persons, or greater than 50% older controlled by current residents of public housing or those in our Section 8 housing choice voucher programs.

And for professional services, those outside of the construction fields, 3% of the value of that contract is contracted to a Section 3 business.  So Section 3 is more than just construction.  So as part of this change, we now have the Workforce Opportunity Resource Center.  This provides technical assistance, business development, and a series of services to Section 3 businesses and workers, as well as folks that do business for CHA to know how they can be successful in employing Section 3 businesses and Section 3 workers.  So I'll stop there.  We can begin to take your questions.  Okay.  Okay, any questions for
