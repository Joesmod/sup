the basic judicial task. Casey, 505 U. S., at 963 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). In suggesting otherwise, the Casey plurality went beyond this Courts role in our constitutional system. The Casey plurality call[ed] the contending sides of a national controversy to end their national division, and claimed the authority to impose a permanent settlement of the issue of a constitutional abortion right simply by saying    68 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court that the matter was closed. Id., at 867. That unprecedented claim exceeded the power vested in us by the Constitution. As Alexander Hamilton famously put it, the Constitution gives the judiciary neither Force nor Will. The Federalist No. 78, p. 523 (J. Cooke ed. 1961). Our sole authority is to exercise judgmentwhich is to say, the authority to judge what the law means and how it should apply to the case at hand. Ibid. The Court has no authority to decree that an erroneous precedent is permanently exempt from evaluation under traditional stare decisis principles. A precedent of this Court is subject to the usual principles of stare decisis under which adherence to precedent is the norm but not an inexorable command. If the rule were otherwise, erroneous decisions like Plessy and Lochner would still be the law. That is not how stare decisis operates. The Casey plurality also misjudged the practical limits of this Courts influence. Roe certainly did not succeed in ending division on the issue of abortion. On the contrary, Roe inflamed a national issue that has remained bitterly divisive for the past half century. Casey, 505 U. S., at 995 (opinion of Scalia, J.); see also R. Ginsburg, Speaking in a Judicial Voice, 67 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 1185, 1208 (1992) (Roe may have halted a political process, prolonged divisiveness, and deferred stable settlement of the issue). And for the past 30 years, Casey has done the same. Neither decision has ended debate over the issue of a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. Indeed, in this case, 26 States expressly ask us to overrule Roe and Casey and to return the issue of abortion to the people and their elected representatives. This Courts inability to end debate on the issue should not have been surprising. This Court cannot bring about the permanent resolution of a rancorous national controversy simply by dictating a settlement and telling the people to move on. Whatever influence the Court may have on public attitudes must stem from the Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 69 Opinion of the Court strength of our opinions, not an attempt to exercise raw judicial power. Roe, 410 U. S., at 222 (White, J., dissenting). We do not pretend to know how our political system or society will respond to todays decision overruling Roe and Casey. And even if we could foresee what will happen, we would have no authority to let that knowledge influence our decision. We can only do our job, which

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

In overruling Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Supreme Court has ruled that there is no constitutional right to an abortion. This does not end debate on the issue, but simply returns it to the people and their elected representatives.
