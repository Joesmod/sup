Why is that any different than a  situation like this?  MS. WAGGONER: Because the specific  objection that you're including is not necessarily in that photograph, but even if it were, this Court has protected vile, awful,  reprehensible, violent speech in the past, and  it has never -- JUSTICE JACKSON: No, I'm just asking you why is the objection of the web designer, as Justice both Kagan and Sotomayor's pointed out, when we look at your examples, they just say things like "Please come to the wedding on this day." MS. WAGGONER: Precisely. It's an invitation to a wedding -- JUSTICE JACKSON: Okay. So I -- MS.

We have a  creative -- a creator of speech and a very clear message -- JUSTICE KAGAN: It may be an edge case meaning it could fall on either side, you're not  sure?  MS. WAGGONER: I am -- I am sure in  that the message isn't in the product. It's not in the photograph. But even if this Court were to find that it was, the Court would still have to protect the speech, and the Court could draw a line in a different place, as it has juxtaposed Loving and Obergefell in terms of the beliefs between same-sex marriage. But it -- JUSTICE KAGAN: So just -- JUSTICE ALITO: In -- JUSTICE


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The conversation is about whether or not a web designer can refuse to take photos of black, Hispanic, and Asian children for a Christmas website. The web designer believes that they should be able to refuse because the children are not of the same race as Santa. However, the other justices point out that the message of the website is not clear, and that the web designer may be engaging in racial discrimination.
