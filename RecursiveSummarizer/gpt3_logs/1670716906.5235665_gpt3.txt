Write a concise summary of the following:


about equity that starting 10 yards behind everybody else.  I think that's what I'm talking about.  I think that's what I'm talking about.  That seems to me to be something of course that that the city and DPS should consider better so I can tell you is that nobody raised it with me, but that doesn't mean that it's not an issue for some people.  Thank you.  And, and we're, and really, and was there also a effort to talk about know we talk a lot about construction.  Not in this study.  And I think that really is because of the way that the city's ordinances are bifurcated, which come out of the result of the builders association challenge to the city's program that was actually filed back in 1996 but we didn't try that case.  We were able to do that in 2003.  And as a result of that the city has two pieces to the program two pieces of ordinances, and the construction portion is the one that set to sunset on September 30 of this year now.  And so our research project was focused strictly on construction.  Got it.  Thank you.  And one, and one last question I can sit here and talk to you for hours but I'm going to live in my questions.  I always have a problem with it and I know you touched upon it recent just a few minutes ago, as our contractors get more successful.  They get larger.  They get more substantial.  But yet when they graduate from the program.  There's not work for them, whether it be with the city or private industry, and they end up coming back.  Is there a concerted effort to deal with those that are will be considered primes to I won't say have a leg up because they're they're doing well and they're doing well because they're doing a good job of what they do, whether it be engineering construction in these fields.  But I don't know if this is a proper question or not but I want to find out is there something that we can do to assist those that are bidding as primes or and encourage those that are black and brown to bid as primes and also bring in


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The city of Detroit is facing a problem with its construction industry ordinances, which are set to expire at the end of September. The city has two pieces to its program, one focused on construction and one on equity. The equity piece is lagging behind, and the city is not doing enough to support black and brown contractors who are successful in the program.
