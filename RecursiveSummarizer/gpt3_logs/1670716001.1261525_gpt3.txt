PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


do not have a memorial, a commitment or funding for this memorial, despite Chicago torture justice memorials efforts.  While the city has refused to spend the money on this promised memorial, it has continued to fund the defense of Burge and his detectives in civil rights cases and federal and state court.  And as Mr Clements said, the city, including this administration, continues to pay private law firms to defend the indefensible in these civil rights cases.  To this point, the city of Chicago has spent $37.5 million to defend officers and the city and the Burge torture cases.  And $43 million in pensions to Burge and his detectives under his command, who were also have found to have committed acts of torture.  Meanwhile, the city has only committed in the last month or so to provide Chicago torture justice memorials $50,000 for a planning grant.  That is unconscionable and is unacceptable.  That is why we are asking you, Chairman Dowell, please bring up the budget amendment today, asking that $2.25 million be added to this budget.  The time is urgent.  Survivors are passing as well as family members.  For decades, the torture survivors were disbelieved and dismissed and discarded by city officials.  The fact that there is no commitment and no funding for this memorial is continuing to traumatize them again.  They should be able to live to see the day that this memorial intended to honor their resilience and perseverance is seen and built.  That is why we are saying justice delayed and justice denied.  Again, Chairman Dowell, you voted in support of this reparations legislation.  We are asking you to fulfill your promise to the survivors.  We're asking all of you as city council members responsible for fulfilling this promise to vote in support of this amendment.  Walk the walk.  Don't just talk the talk about condemning racist police violence and supporting people who have survived that violence.  Thank you.  Thank you, Ms.  Mogul.  The last speaker is Jeremy


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

Chicago torture survivors and family members are asking the city council to add $2.25 million to the budget for a memorial to honor their resilience and perseverance. The city has failed to provide any funding for the memorial, despite promises to do so, and survivors are passing away without seeing the memorial built.
