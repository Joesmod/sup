PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


facilities because when it comes down to spaces.  You know, I think that there's a lot of opportunity there and the management, again goes back to efficiency, you know, where you know what is the level of commitment to be able to provide these services to young people who are in dire need.  Let me rephrase that question.  I appreciate the feedback and I think that's something we could definitely look at around our mental health facilities.  Again, you know, I think we are, we are committed with our capital funding is to, you know, improve our facilities to continue to upgrade and maintain them and so that is, that is part of you know the package we brought to finance committee yesterday and keeping up with all of our costs around that and keeping our facilities, you know, up to date and state of the art.  I'll add here when Dr.  Arwati and I see that she's still here presented her budget.  She talked about the fact that they that we have more than doubled our access and support to people having mental health challenges, and that we had actually increased services to young people.  I don't know if you want to add anything to that Dr Arwati so we can move on.  Yeah, and happy to talk with you offline but I just want to reiterate that in 2019.  We served 3600 Chicagoans with mental health services.  This year, we are serving 60,000 next year we're on track for 75,000 and more importantly, by the end of this calendar year, we anticipate having a high quality available to everybody, publicly funded mental health site in every one of yours of the 77 communities.  That's a huge increase.  It's a big success, pulling together a system of the federally funded the state funded the county funded and the city funded mental health clinics and supports, and that's the bricks and mortar piece.  In addition, we've built all kinds of additional outreach to the people who are not stable enough to really come into attending an appointment on a Tuesday.  So I really want to emphasize
