PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


pool, as Leonard explained, is established by our procurement.  So if you're not in that pre-qualified pool, whether you're in that pre-qualified pool or not, I should say, you have the ability to bid on CHA's projects that are not part of the pre-qualified pool.  So, and that is with our private property managers, they are required to use Section 3 businesses for unit turn work.  Our developers are required to hire Section 3 businesses and workers on their projects.  So these opportunities exist throughout all of our contracting functions.  So specifically going back to a unit turn work, which was something that CHA, and I think a lot of these contractors primarily work toward, your basis now is that this work is not being done directly by CHA, but now being done directly by the private property management firms that you all employ in the process, is that correct? Alderman, excuse me, Chairman, that is correct.  From a unit turn perspective, the bulk of that work is now handled with our property management firms, who, as I mentioned earlier, are required to utilize Section 3 companies for that work.  And is that work restricted to only Section 3 companies or is it a mixture of vendors that can be utilized for that work? So if you're not Section 3 certified, then you're not eligible.  Okay, and then that unit turn work, is that commiserate to what it had been in the past? Is it more, is it less? How would you term that? So the unit turn work that we're going through now, I'll say kind of meet CHA's need as far as unit turns to really meet our core mission of housing people.  So kind of the budget that we put together specifically for unit turns is what we need and what we'll push out to the Section 3 vendors for those bidding opportunities.  Okay.  Any other, any questions by members of the committee? Okay.  Anything else you gentlemen wish to add? No, I would just say, and I've talked to some of you separately about Section 3 and changes and we are willing to help


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) has a pool of pre-qualified vendors for its contracting work, and requires that private property managers and developers use Section 3 businesses and workers for unit turn work. This work is now being done primarily by private property management firms, and is restricted to only Section 3 companies. The budget for unit turns is what is needed to meet CHA's core mission of housing people.
