Write a concise summary of the following:


every worker is an employee wherever every employee is a worker but every worker is not an employee that's exactly right and so that's i i'm that's that's a little troubling so i'm going to move on because i don't want to take up too much more time uh and the penalty violation you talk about the adjudicator yes in what venue would that be so that could be at for example at the department of labor standards it could be uh it could be a judge in circuit court okay and then on page 15 subsection 10 to issue the environmental protection and to issue an emergency non-emergency cessation order and abate conditions that create a threat to public health um who's going to pay for those conditions that would be for the abatement of those conditions i'm gonna ask um dr arwadi to expand from that you're hearing me there alison i already cdph um so we have funding to do the abatement um in some cases this comes from the federal government in some cases it comes from the state in some cases it comes uh from this body or from council and this is allowing us the authority to be able to do the remediation and enter into cleanup agreement so it we have this already for abatement but we didn't have it for remediation and those are two different groups so it's not about funding it's just making sure that we have the ability to do the cleanup when you all uh make sure we have funding to do it okay thank you and then just one last real quick on the short-term residential rental intermediary though the one to nine the last one on page 26 the short-term residential so if there's one short-term residential rental they have to pay 250 plus 60 dollars so 310 dollars if they have an intermediary am i reading that correctly um i don't know uh mr meyer you want to follow up on that i think this is on page 26 alderman 26 yes i'm just for the one and and and the concern is if i have a two flat or a three flat and i'm doing that short term does this license fee apply so this is for the smaller

RESPONSE:

The ordinance being discussed would allow the Department of Public Health to issue orders to clean up conditions that pose a threat to public health, and would also establish a licensing fee for short-term residential rentals.
