PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


are not at parity with the population we have at the city.  You've got 30% Latino, 30% black, 30% white, but depending on where the area is located in the racial mix, it might unduly force anyone who's hiring to kind of exclude certain populations because it's based mostly on where the geography is.  So having an understanding of what that looks like would be important.  I think to our colleague, Alderman Villegas bringing it up, perhaps raising the threshold higher creates a mix that might be more equitable, it might be more parity when you think of the city, but without having that information in advance, I don't think that one can make the decision or know what effect that would have when it comes to hiring.  Well, I think one of the challenges that you face is that you're not using race as a basis to make any of these decisions.  And that's, it's an objective criteria.  When you start to get into race-based points on this, that's where procurement is telling us that's where we can kind of run a file of a federal law.  And so that's why you're looking at it from a perspective of purely objective measures that aren't race-based.  Oh, I completely understand that.  The challenge though, is if you do it this way, you could unintentionally exclude people in a way that is also problematic and leads to larger lawsuits.  So that's why having an understanding of what the balance is should be something that's discussed as well before any vote would be taken on something like this.  Because I think what we wanna do is make sure that we know that we've got communities, black and brown that aren't being hired at the levels that they should be.  And so we wanna make sure that as we move forward as a city together, that there is a parity in looking at that.  And I agree with you, you can't legislate to race-based, but also by enacting laws that could in effect, and I apologize for any connotation, would redline other communities out based on how you're doing the map, we have
