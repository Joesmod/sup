policies that benefit families and our most vulnerable neighbors and plow the sidewalks.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  Our next speaker is Abla Garib.  Good morning.  Thank you for giving me this opportunity to talk.  I'm a motorized wheelchair user.  Like I said, my name is Abla Garib.  I live in the city.  So I just wanted to share my experience so you can understand the urgency of having this include this plow, the snow off the sidewalk.  So as I attempt to use my motorized wheelchair to go to my doctor appointment, I've been stuck a lot of times unable to make my appointments because usually they plow the snow and put it right where the crossroads are and I can't get through or they make it so narrow that the wheelchair can't go through.

So as you see, this is not only important for people in the wheelchair, it's important for the whole community and it's really important to set aside the budget so we can pass this.

Yet 100% of people in the city of Chicago use a sidewalk day to day to get around.  I want to call upon Chicago's equity statement of principles.  It's supposed to, in the description on the Chicago website, prioritize access and opportunities for groups that are underserved and
