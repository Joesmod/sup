issue here.  And you can see if you just open up your heart and cross that line a little bit, we can help some of these children.  And that's what you're doing.  You're doing that by not being that police officer in the school, talking to them as if they are criminals already.  No, you are reaching out to them as a human being and mother or daughter or your niece or nephew.  That's the way you're treating them.  That's why they're so open to you.  You take off that badge of your regular duty of a police officer and give to them the other side.  I am so grateful to you for being that mother there for him, being that mentor for him.

That's what the world is all about.  So let me say thank you again from the bottom of my heart for all of the residents and all of them who can't say thank you.  Your story should be told more.
