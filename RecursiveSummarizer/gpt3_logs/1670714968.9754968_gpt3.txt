PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


sudden, once the project's done, they.  They let them go.  So I'm just curious as to whether or not.  They had that discussion with the associations as well.  Anecdotally.  And I think that's a good question.  I think that's a good question.  And I've heard that again, they are working to meet the required.  And you can't meet the requirement.  Was somebody from Roseland.  And Garfield park and vice versa.  So therefore it disincentivizes.  And so we're trying to meet the requirements that have been set forth.  Outside of a particular project area in order to meet the requirements that have been set forth by us.  And in some respects.  It is a, it is our doing that as a, that has created this.  And so by somewhat changing, not saying that you can't hire someone from a project area, but to be a part of the project, and so if you want to create opportunities for people to work on jobs.  I know that we have to think a little broader than just the one individual or the one individual ward.  Look at how we can help create opportunities.  Live.  More people out of, out of poverty.  So anecdotally it's yeah.  I've got to meet this requirement.  So I can't bring someone from one community to another unless they were someone that were with us.  When you look at the requirements of that nature, this is where we get anecdotally.  As far as any empirical evidence that we can sustain that.  I can't answer that today, but we know that this continuously happens because how many people do we know? They get a chance to move from this job to the next job.  That's in another community.  Those numbers generally are very low, if at all.  Yeah.  Well, I would just say that.  I think that's a good question.  I think that's a good question.  Although.  If it's a goal that we're, that we've set and said, we want to obtain this goal.  Then there has to be a good faith effort.  That's analyzed.  By DPS to determine whether or not.  With the intent that the contractor is intending to try to

RESPONSE:

The question is whether or not the city is doing enough to incentivize contractors to hire employees from the same community in which the project is taking place. Anecdotally, it seems that this is not happening very often, and that it may be due to the city's requirements. It is unclear whether or not there is any empirical evidence to support this claim.
