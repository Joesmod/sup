DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

In 1868, the state of Maryland passed a law making it a crime to administer any poison, drug, or other noxious thing to a woman pregnant with child, or to sell any such thing, with the intent to procure abortion. The penalty for this crime was imprisonment for not less than three years, or a fine of not less than five hundred dollars, or both. In 1873, the state of Nebraska expanded this law to include the use of any means whatsoever for the purpose of producing abortion, and increased the penalties to include a fine of not less than one thousand dollars. The purpose of this law was to protect women from the dangers of illegal abortions, which were often performed by untrained practitioners using dangerous methods. The law did not criminalize abortion itself, but only the means used to procure it. This law remained in effect until it was repealed in 1967.
