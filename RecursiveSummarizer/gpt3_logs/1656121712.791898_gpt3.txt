Write a concise summary of the following:

Constitution will, todays majority holds, provide no shield, despite its guarantees of liberty and equality for all. And no one should be confident that this majority is done with its work. The right Roe and Casey recognized does not stand alone. To the contrary, the Court has linked it for decades to other settled freedoms involving bodily integrity, familial relationships, and procreation. Most obviously, the right to terminate a pregnancy arose straight out of the right to purchase and use contraception. See Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965); Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438 (1972). In turn, those rights led, more recently,  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 5 BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting to rights of same-sex intimacy and marriage. See Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558 (2003); Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U. S. 644 (2015). They are all part of the same constitutional fabric, protecting autonomous decisionmaking over the most personal of life decisions. The majority (or to be more accurate, most of it) is eager to tell us today that nothing it does cast[s] doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion. Ante, at 66; cf. ante, at 3 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (advocating the overruling of Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell). But how could that be? The lone rationale for what the majority does today is that the right to elect an abortion is not deeply rooted in history: Not until Roe, the majority argues, did people think abortion fell within the Constitutions guarantee of liberty. Ante, at 32. The same could be said, though, of most of the rights the majority claims it is not tampering with. The majority could write just as long an opinion showing, for example, that until the mid-20th century, there was no support in American law for a constitutional right to obtain [contraceptives]. Ante, at 15. So one of two things must be true. Either the majority does not really believe in its own reasoning. Or if it does, all rights that have no history stretching back to the mid19th century are insecure. Either the mass of the majoritys opinion is hypocrisy, or additional constitutional rights are under threat. It is one or the other. One piece of evidence on that score seems especially salient: The majoritys cavalier approach to overturning this Courts precedents. Stare decisis is the Latin phrase for a foundation stone of the rule of law: that things decided should stay decided unless there is a very good reason for change. It is a doctrine of judicial modesty and humility. Those qualities are not evident in todays opinion. The majority has no good reason for the upheaval in law and society it sets off. Roe and Casey have been the law of the land for decades, shaping womens expectations of their choices when an unplanned pregnancy occurs. Women have relied   6 DOBBS v.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The majority in this case holds that the Constitution will provide no shield against today's majority, despite its guarantees of liberty and equality for all. This means that the right to an abortion is not deeply rooted in history and is therefore not protected by the Constitution. The dissenting opinion argues that this is hypocritical and that the majority is simply overturning precedent without a good reason.
