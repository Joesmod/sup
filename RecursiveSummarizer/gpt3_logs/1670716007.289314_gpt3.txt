PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


20,000 reports citywide since 2019.  Given how cumbersome it is to file 311 reports, imagine how many unplod sidewalks there actually are in the city.  I sent an email to each of your offices last week with the specific numbers for your ward.  The city chose to clear the road network of snow yet only two-thirds of Chicagoans own cars.  100% of Chicagoans use the sidewalk network, whether it's to walk or roll to their vehicle or all the way to their destination.  Toronto, a city with the same population as Chicago, has been clearing sidewalks for years.  I urge you to support a citywide municipal sidewalk snow removal program and include the $750,000 pilot program in the upcoming city budget.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr.  Frisch.  We'll now move to those witnesses here with us in person.  The first speaker is DeTonia Jefferson Dunbar.  Good morning, everyone.  Good morning.  I'm councilperson Peddell, would you please, if you would please sign this, pay our passes, amendment to plow the sidewalks because I'm in your ward.  I'm in third ward.  Also, I live in the Hilliers, which is in between the red line and the green line.  And because there are several businesses that have been closed down, when I'm headed toward the green line, I have to go on the street if the snow is allowed.  And that's extremely dangerous.  As well as the red line, going under the body, I guess, never plow.  If I need to go to the red line again, I have to get in the streets.  And even if I'm stuck, preferably a person will help me get out.  If not, I'm just stuck there.  And if you could just please pass this, apply the snow.  I'd appreciate it.  You've done so much for our community.  And I appreciate that.  I would appreciate it even more if you pass this.  It's very important because I don't want to be just confined to my house.  I do like to travel.  And I am sick in employment.  And I need to just be able to get out and about.  My ability to use the peer transit services is limited.  I
