S. 26, 40 (1994) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). The resolution of this case is thus straightforward. Because the Due Process Clause does not secure any substantive rights, it does not secure a right to abortion. The Court today declines to disturb substantive due process jurisprudence generally or the doctrines application in other, specific contexts. Cases like Griswold v. Connecticut, Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 3 THOMAS, J., concurring 381 U. S. 479 (1965) (right of married persons to obtain contraceptives)*; Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.

The Courts abortion cases are unique, see ante, at 3132, 66, 7172, and no party has asked us to decide whether our entire Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence must be preserved or revised, McDonald, 561 U.

For that reason, in future cases, we should reconsider all of this Courts substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell. Because any substantive due process decision is demonstrably erroneous, Ramos v. Louisiana, 590 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 7), we have a duty to correct the error established in those precedents, Gamble v. United States, 587 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (slip op., at 9). After overruling these demonstrably erroneous decisions, the question would remain whether other constitutional provisions guarantee the myriad rights that our substantive due process cases have generated. For example, we could consider whether any of the rights announced in this Courts substantive due process cases are privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.

S., at 484. Since Griswold, the Court, perhaps recognizing the facial absurdity of Griswolds penumbral argument, has characterized the decision as one rooted in substantive due process. See, e.g., Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U. S. 644, 663 (2015); Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 720 (1997).    4 DOBBS v.

RESPONSE:

The Court today declined to overturn its previous rulings on abortion, which are based on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. However, Justice Thomas, in a concurring opinion, called for the Court to reconsider all of its previous rulings on substantive due process, including those involving abortion. He argued that these rulings are based on an erroneous interpretation of the Due Process Clause and that other constitutional provisions may provide protections for the rights announced in these cases.
