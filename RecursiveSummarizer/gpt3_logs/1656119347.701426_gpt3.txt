DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

In 1952, the state of Mississippi passed a law making it a crime to use any poison or noxious thing to cause a woman to miscarry, or to use any instrument to do so maliciously. The law provided for a fine of up to $1,000 and imprisonment for up to five years if the woman was then quick with child, and a fine of up to $500 and imprisonment for up to two years if she was not. In 1961, the state of Colorado passed a law making it a crime to administer any substance or to use any instrument with the intention of causing a miscarriage, unless it was necessary to save the life of the mother. The penalty was imprisonment for up to three years and a fine of up to $1,000. These laws were challenged in the Supreme Court case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, with the plaintiffs arguing that they violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, striking down the Mississippi and Colorado laws as unconstitutional. The Court held that the laws were not narrowly tailored to achieve a legitimate state interest, and that they placed an undue burden on women's right to choose whether or not to have an abortion.
