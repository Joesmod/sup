the majority picks the latter. This framing is not accurate. In its brief on the merits, Mississippi in fact argued at length that a decision simply rejecting the viability rule would result in a judgment in its favor. See Brief for Petitioners 5, 3848. But even if the State had not argued as much, it would not matter. There is no rule that parties can confine this Court to disposing of their case on a particular groundlet alone when review was sought and granted on a different one. Our established practice is instead not to formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied. Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party, 552 U. S. 442, 450 (2008) (quoting Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring)); see also United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 21 (1960).  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 7 ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment Following that fundamental principle of judicial restraint, Washington State Grange, 552 U. S., at 450, we should begin with the narrowest basis for disposition, proceeding to consider a broader one only if necessary to resolve the case at hand. See, e.g., Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond, 496 U. S. 414, 423 (1990). It is only where there is no valid narrower ground of decision that we should go on to address a broader issue, such as whether a constitutional decision should be overturned. See Federal Election Commn v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., 551 U. S. 449, 482 (2007) (declining to address the claim that a constitutional decision should be overruled when the appellant prevailed on its narrower constitutional argument). Here, there is a clear path to deciding this case correctly without overruling Roe all the way down to the studs: recognize that the viability line must be discarded, as the majority rightly does, and leave for another day whether to reject any right to an abortion at all. See Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S. 490, 518, 521 (1989) (plurality opinion) (rejecting Roes viability line as rigid and indeterminate, while also finding no occasion to revisit the holding of Roe that, under the Constitution, a State must provide an opportunity to choose to terminate a pregnancy). Of course, such an approach would not be available if the rationale of Roe and Casey was inextricably entangled with and dependent upon the viability standard. It is not. Our precedents in this area ground the abortion right in a womans right to choose. See Carey v. Population Services Intl, 431 U. S. 678, 688689 (1977) (underlying foundation of the holdings in Roe and Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965), was the right of decision in matters of childbearing); Maher v. Roe, 432 U. S. 464, 473 (1977) (Roe and other cases recognize a constitutionally protected interest in making certain kinds of important decisions free from governmental compulsion (internal quotation marks

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court has ruled that the right to an abortion is a constitutional right, and that this right is not dependent on the viability of the fetus.
