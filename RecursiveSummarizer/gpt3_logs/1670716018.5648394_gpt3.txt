went to oil and gas companies to line their pocketbook for profits.  What did we gain as a city giving people gas cards compared to giving people 100% access to the city through a clear sidewalk in the wintertime? I primarily get around by bike, but in the few times that I do walk in the wintertime, I'm an able-bodied person and I still struggle when I'm trying to carry my groceries home from the grocery store that's about three quarters of a mile from my home.

And so in the winters, when I need to go walk my dog in my neighborhood, it gets very dangerous if she sees something that's interesting to her, or if I just slip and fall on the ice, I can injure myself and not be able to make a living.  I also love walking around my neighborhood and supporting the local businesses in the Bucktown and the Wicker Park and the Ukrainian village neighborhoods, because I can get to those on foot.
