residents of bronze Douglas and also residents of Bridgeport.  These are communities that have been growing over time.  The population explosion is huge.  And we have over 2000 high school students that now attend over 100 different high schools.  They have to travel outside of their communities when they should be able to go to school in their area.  I too, like you Alderman Lee went to a very diverse high school.  It was an experience for me coming from the community that I came from.  And I think that all children should be educated in that kind of environment where they can learn about different cultures, understand different perspectives and history.  It bodes well for how you grow up and become an adult.  So I was getting ready to call you Alderman.  Mayor Lightfoot, I want to thank you for your support on this.  I also want to thank CPS and the Chicago Housing Authority.  I think it's important and Alderman Moore has raised this issue.  We are gonna watch out for those residents at CHA.  The commitment is to turn back 244 units.  That commitment goes back to 2011, unfortunately, but we're gonna do that and we're well on our way.  By the end of next year, we'll have over 40% of those units built.  And the commitment, as long as I'm sitting in this seat is to make sure that those CHA residents, those promises are honored by the CHA.  So I make that commitment to you.  I'm all in on this high school.  The only reason I'm running for reelection is because I wanna do that school in addition to some other things that I wanna see happen in the ward.  But I ask for all, I understand the concerns of some of my colleagues here, but this is the right thing to do and come hell or high water, we're gonna see it to the end.  Thank you.  Thank you.  The chair recognizes Alderman Burnett.  Thank you very much, Madam President.  So I like to also rise as a supporter of this high school.  And I like to commend Alderman Lee for coming out of the gate early, fast, and getting
