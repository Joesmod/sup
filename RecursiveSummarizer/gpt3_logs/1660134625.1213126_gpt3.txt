RESPONSE:

The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 requires that manufacturers of biosimilar biological products be treated as one manufacturer for purposes of pricing. This rule applies to partnerships, syndicates, groups, joint ventures, or other organizations through which any business, financial operation, or venture is carried on. If a determination of high likelihood is made that a biosimilar biological product has not been licensed and marketed during the time period between the selected drug publication date on which the biological product would have been included on the list as a selected drug pursuant to subsection (a) but for sub paragraph (A) and the selected drug publication date with respect to the initial price applicability year that is 1 year after the initial price applicability year for which such biological product would have been included as a selected drug on such list, the Secretary shall delay the inclusion of the biological product as a selected drug on the list published under subsection (a) until such list is published with respect to the initial price applicability year that is 1 year after the initial price applicability year for which the biological product would have been included as a selected drug on such list.
