Kortsmit et al., Abortion Surveillance—United States, 2019, 70 Morbidity and Mortality Report, Surveillance Summaries, p. 20 (Nov. 26, 2021) (Table 6). For our part, we do not question the motives of either those who have supported or those who have opposed laws restricting abortions.  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 31 Opinion of the Court wish about “existence,” “meaning,” the “universe,” and “the mystery of human life,” they are not always free to act in accordance with those thoughts. License to act on the basis of such beliefs may correspond to one of the many understandings of “liberty,” but it is certainly not “ordered liberty.” Ordered liberty sets limits and defines the boundary between competing interests. Roe and Casey each struck a particular balance between the interests of a woman who wants an abortion and the interests of what they termed “potential life.” Roe, 410 U. S., at 150 (emphasis deleted); Casey, 505 U. S., at 852. But the people of the various States may evaluate those interests differently. In some States, voters may believe that the abortion right should be even more extensive than the right that Roe and Casey recognized. Voters in other States may wish to impose tight restrictions based on their belief that abortion destroys an “unborn human being.” Miss. Code Ann. §41–41–191(4)(b). Our Nation’s historical understanding of ordered liberty does not prevent the people’s elected representatives from deciding how abortion should be regulated. Nor does the right to obtain an abortion have a sound basis in precedent. Casey relied on cases involving the right to marry a person of a different race, Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967); the right to marry while in prison, Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78 (1987); the right to obtain contraceptives, Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965), Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438 (1972), Carey v. Population Services Int’l, 431 U. S. 678 (1977); the right to reside with relatives, Moore v. East Cleveland, 431 U. S. 494 (1977); the right to make decisions about the education of one’s children, Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510 (1925), Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390 (1923); the right not to be sterilized without consent, Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U. S. 535 (1942); and the right in certain circumstances not to undergo involuntary surgery, forced  32 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court administration of drugs, or other substantially similar procedures, Winston v. Lee, 470 U. S. 753 (1985), Washington v. Harper, 494 U. S. 210 (1990), Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165 (1952). Respondents and the Solicitor General also rely on post-Casey decisions like Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558 (2003) (right to engage in private, consensual sexual acts), and Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U. S. 644 (2015) (right to marry a person of the same sex). See Brief

DETAILED SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

The Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), K. Kortsmit et al., recently released a report on abortion surveillance in the United States for 2019. The report includes data on the number of abortions, the abortion rate, the distribution of abortions by characteristics of the women obtaining them, and the methods used to obtain abortions. The CDC found that there were 862,320 abortions in the United States in 2019, a decrease of 2% from 2018. The abortion rate was 13.5 abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age, also a decrease from 2018. The majority of abortions (61.1%) were obtained by women in their 20s, and the majority of abortions (72.3%) were performed at or before 8 weeks of gestation. The most common method of abortion was medication abortion (39.7%), followed by aspiration (28.5%). The report also includes data on the number of abortions by state. The states with the highest number of abortions were California (207,990), Texas (86,830), and Florida (83,730). The states with the highest abortion rates were New York (24.1 per 1,000 women of reproductive age), New Jersey (22.3 per 1,000 women of reproductive age), and Connecticut (20.4 per 1,000 women of reproductive age). This report provides valuable data on the number and characteristics of abortions in the United States. The data can be used to inform policies and programs aimed at reducing the number of abortions.
