hard to see where the greatest burden will fall. Casey, 505 U. S., at 855. In States that bar abortion, women of means will still be able to travel to obtain the services they need.25 It is women who cannot afford to do so who will suffer most. These are the women most likely to seek abortion care in the first place. Women living below the federal poverty line experience unintended pregnancies at rates five times higher than higher income women do, and nearly half of women who seek abortion care live in households below the poverty line. See Brief for 547 Deans 7; Brief for Abortion Funds and Practical Support Organizations as Amici Curiae 8 (Brief for Abortion Funds).  25This statement of course assumes that States are not successful in preventing interstate travel to obtain an abortion. See supra, at 3, 36 37. Even assuming that is so, increased out-of-state demand will lead to longer wait times and decreased availability of service in States still providing abortions. See Brief for State of California et al. as Amici Curiae 2527. This is what happened in Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, New Mexico, and Nevada last fall after Texas effectively banned abortions past six weeks of gestation. See United States v. Texas, 595 U.

See Brief for Abortion Funds 7 12.26 After today, in States where legal abortions are not available, they will lose any ability to obtain safe, legal abortion care. They will not have the money to make the trip necessary; or to obtain childcare for that time; or to take time off work. Many will endure the costs and risks of pregnancy and giving birth against their wishes. Others will turn in desperation to illegal and unsafe abortions. They may lose not just their freedom, but their lives.27 Finally, the expectation of reproductive control is integral to many womens identity and their place in the Nation. See Casey, 505 U. S., at 856. That expectation helps define  26The average cost of a first-trimester abortion is about $500. See Brief for Abortion Funds 7. Federal insurance generally does not cover the cost of abortion, and 35 percent of American adults do not have cash on hand to cover an unexpected expense that high. Guttmacher Institute, M. Donovan, In Real Life: Federal Restrictions on Abortion Coverage and the Women They Impact (Jan. 5, 2017), https://www. guttmacher.org/gpr/2017/01/real-life-federal-restrictions-abortion-coverageand-women-they-impact#:~:text=Although%20the%20Hyde%20Amendment% 20bars,provide%20abortion%20coverage%20to%20enrollees; Brief for Abortion Funds 11. 27Mississippi is likely to be one of the States where these costs are highest, though history shows that it will have

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court's ruling in Roe v. Wade has been overturned, and states are now able to ban abortion. This will have a particularly hard impact on low-income women, who will not be able to afford to travel to states where abortion is still legal. Many will be forced to turn to illegal and unsafe abortions, which could lead to their death.
