Write a concise summary of the following:


this body will pass.  And with the death of seniors in Rogers Park as a result of not being prepared as a city to deal with climate change and record heat with people suffering losses to their property as a result of record flooding occurring regularly in our city, and we still do not have a Department of the Environment.  So I find it insulting.  I find it disrespectful to the people who voted for change that in this budget.  After four years the fourth budget that this mayor will now propose and pass, we have failed to get to a Department of the Environment, and the 10 positions in this office.  That's less than the 15 in the mayor's press office.  So if you want to talk about where our priorities lie as a city, I think it's pretty clear from this budget appropriation.  There are a few questions that I believe deserve clarification and that should be on the record.  A number of people have been fighting for many years now to get the Chicago torture justice memorial built.  Is there funding in this appropriation to get that done? Yes, there is funding within DK's budget existing.  It's not coming before you in an amendment, but there is funding set aside for this planning process.  So it is not in this budget.  It's not in the amendment, but it's already there.  It's not in the amendment, but it's in funding that is for DK's.  Yes, under DK's.  Do we know what line item it's in for DK's? I do not have that in front of me but I can definitely provide that through the chair.  And do we know the amount? It's about 250,000.  And this 250,000 is for planning purposes.  It's just for planning.  I think, you know, my understanding, and you know I don't speak too far ahead of Commissioner Harkie who's been working this planning process, but it's also for planning as we determine kind of what the full needs are around that.  Okay, thank you.  Does this appropriation continue to include the $8.9 million allocated for ShotSpotter technology? Yes, that line is still there in
