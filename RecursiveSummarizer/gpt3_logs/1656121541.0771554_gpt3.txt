Write a concise summary of the following:

abortion at all, post, at 7, and would hold only that if the Constitution protects any such right, the right ends once women have had a reasonable opportunity to obtain an abortion, post, at 1. The concurrence does not specify what period of time is sufficient to provide such an opportunity, but it would hold that 15 weeks, the period allowed under Mississippis law, is enoughat least absent rare circumstances. Post, at 2, 10. There are serious problems with this approach, and it is revealing that nothing like it was recommended by either party. As we have recounted, both parties and the Solicitor General have urged us either to reaffirm or overrule Roe and Casey. See supra, at 45. And when the specific approach advanced by the concurrence was broached at oral argument, both respondents and the Solicitor General emphatically rejected it. Respondents counsel termed it completely unworkable and less principled and less workable than viability. Tr. of Oral Arg. 54. The Solicitor General argued that abandoning the viability line would leave courts and others with no continued guidance. Id., at 101. What is more, the concurrence has not identified any of the Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 73 Opinion of the Court more than 130 amicus briefs filed in this case that advocated its approach. The concurrence would do exactly what it criticizes Roe for doing: pulling out of thin air a test that [n]o party or amicus asked the Court to adopt. Post, at 3. 2 The concurrences most fundamental defect is its failure to offer any principled basis for its approach. The concurrence would discar[d] the rule from Roe and Casey that a womans right to terminate her pregnancy extends up to the point that the fetus is regarded as viable outside the womb. Post, at 2. But this rule was a critical component of the holdings in Roe and Casey, and stare decisis is a doctrine of preservation, not transformation, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commn, 558 U. S. 310, 384 (2010) (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring). Therefore, a new rule that discards the viability rule cannot be defended on stare decisis grounds. The concurrence concedes that its approach would not be available if the rationale of Roe and Casey were inextricably entangled with and dependent upon the viability standard. Post, at 7. But the concurrence asserts that the viability line is separable from the constitutional right they recognized, and can therefore be discarded without disturbing any past precedent. Post, at 78. That is simply incorrect. Roes trimester rule was expressly tied to viability, see 410 U. S., at 163164, and viability played a critical role in later abortion decisions. For example, in Planned Parenthood of Central Mo. v. Danforth, 428 U. S. 52, the Court reiterated Roes rule that a State may regulate an abortion to protect the life of the fetus and even may proscribe abortion at the stage subsequent to viability. 428 U. S., at 61 (emphasis added). The Court

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Court holds that the Mississippi law is unconstitutional. The law would ban abortion after 15 weeks, with no exceptions for rape, incest, or health of the mother. The Court finds that this law violates the right to privacy established in Roe v. Wade and reaffirmed in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. The Court also finds that the law is unconstitutional because it places an undue burden on a woman's right to choose.
