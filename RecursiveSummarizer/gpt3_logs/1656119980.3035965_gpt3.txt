DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

In the recent case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the Supreme Court considered whether to overturn the precedent set in Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639 (1990). In Walton, the Court had held that a state could require a defendant to prove his or her lack of mental culpability beyond a reasonable doubt in order to avoid a death sentence. The Court in Dobbs, however, found that this rule was incompatible with the later decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U. S. 466 (2000). In Apprendi, the Court held that any factual finding that increases the maximum punishment for a crime must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, the Court in Dobbs overruled Walton and held that a defendant must prove his or her lack of mental culpability beyond a reasonable doubt in order to avoid a death sentence. The Court also considered whether to overturn the precedent set in Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U. S. 402 (1985). In Aguilar, the Court had held that government aid to religious instruction in public schools violated the Establishment Clause. However, in light of subsequent developments in equal protection law, the Court in Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 235–236 (1997), found that Aguilar was no longer good law. The Court accordingly overruled Aguilar and held that government aid to religious instruction in public schools does not violate the Establishment Clause. Finally, the Court considered whether to overturn the precedent set in Swain v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 202 (1965). In Swain, the Court had held that a defendant must make a showing of purposeful racial discrimination in the selection of a jury venire in order to prove a Batson violation. However, in light of subsequent developments in equal protection law, the Court in Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 79, 93–96 (1986), found that this rule was no longer good law. The Court accordingly overruled Swain and held that a defendant may make a prima facie showing of purposeful racial discrimination in the selection of a jury venire by relying solely on the facts in his or her case.
