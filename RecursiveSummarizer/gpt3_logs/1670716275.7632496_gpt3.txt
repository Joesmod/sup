Write a concise summary of the following:


quantitative data on us so we can make our case, they respond that they need the very same data to make the change.  We've been stuck in this chicken and egg cycle for several decades.  However, as I've indicated to you earlier, there does exist some quantitative data from our community.  Due to the US Census Bureau's community survey done annually and academia, such as the University of Illinois and Marquette University.  And as I have said earlier, we all know there's a wealth of qualitative data.  So therefore our Arab American community is respectfully asking this committee to take steps to move our case forward.  First, that the committee itself direct that a study be conducted on discrimination against Arab Americans using available data sets and or to begin collecting data on Arab Americans, and that the committee sponsor a bill before the city council to the same effect, and that the committee recommend the very same to the mayor's office.  Now I've seen this morning, a substitute resolution prepared by Alderman the legacy staff and I'm very grateful to the Alderman for helping us along the way.  And it adds a few paragraphs on the substitute resolution, which I fully support, and it reflects exactly what we're asking for it is that it be resolved that we, the members of the city council of the city of Chicago, call for a study to be conducted regarding inclusion of Mina Americans as a minority group for purposes of the city's construction MBE minority business enterprise program.  And that is partly based on another new paragraph in this resolution, which sites, the community survey done by the Census Bureau, as at least a beginning of some of the data sets that we have in a quantitative sense.  So with that, I'm going to thank you for giving me the opportunity to address you, and I'll take any questions if you have any.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Thank you, judge.  Chairman Vegas.  Thank you.  Thank you, Chairman.  The, the, the mean of resolution, you know
