Write a concise summary of the following:


you envision as we move forward with the city investing in technology.  So there'll be hundreds of millions of dollars that are thrown at AIS in order to modify the IT.  But we got to be strategic, because those dollars don't come around very often.  So looking forward to working with you to implement the technology upgrades.  And very excited about your appointment.  So looking forward to working with you, Sandra.  Thank you very much, Alderman.  Thank you, Alderman.  I want to acknowledge Alderman Coleman, a non-member who joined us this morning.  Next questions come from Alderman Solowski Garza.  Thank you, Chairwoman.  Commissioner Blakemore.  Well, hello.  I know you've been here for a while.  I just have a quick question about technology.  So all of our offices pay for phones.  We pay for printers.  And we all pay different amounts.  This is something that we talked about four years ago.  I know you weren't here, but is there a way that the city can kind of maybe bundle? Now I sound like the progressive commercial, but can we get a better price for printers and for phone service? Because it runs the gamut on what each of us pay.  And I think that if we can get 50 offices under one roof for printers and phones, it might be a huge cost saving to the city.  Yes, Alderman.  I would like the opportunity to look at that because I believe in leveraging the power of the city of Chicago to get better pricing for us.  We really need to really push leveraging our economies of scale.  So I'd like the opportunity to look at how we can get better pricing on technology, equipment, and services for the award offices.  Awesome.  Anything that I could do to help, please let me know.  Maybe you could start by asking each Alderman what they pay for their phone systems and their printers or something.  So that's all.  Thank you and welcome aboard.  Thank you.  Thank you, Alderman.  Alderman Capelman.  Madam Chair, good morning.  I'm a former Franciscan friar and I say that because
