CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act amends the Internal Revenue Code to create a new section 45Q, which provides a tax credit for carbon capture and sequestration. The credit is equal to $50 per metric ton of qualified carbon dioxide captured and stored in a qualified facility, and is available for 12 years. There are several requirements that must be met in order to qualify for the credit, including wage, apprenticeship, and recordkeeping requirements. The credit is reduced for tax-exempt bonds, and the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to issue regulations or other guidance as necessary to carry out the purposes of the section.
