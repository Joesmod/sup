as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 43 Opinion of the Court American constitutional law as we know it would be unrecognizable, and this would be a different country. No Justice of this Court has ever argued that the Court should never overrule a constitutional decision, but overruling a precedent is a serious matter. It is not a step that should be taken lightly. Our cases have attempted to provide a framework for deciding when a precedent should be overruled, and they have identified factors that should be considered in making such a decision. Janus v. State, County, and Municipal Employees, 585 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2018) (slip op., at 34–35); Ramos v. Louisiana, 590 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2020) (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring in part) (slip op., at 7–9). In this case, five factors weigh strongly in favor of overruling Roe and Casey: the nature of their error, the quality of their reasoning, the “workability” of the rules they imposed on the country, their disruptive effect on other areas of the law, and the absence of concrete reliance. A The nature of the Court’s error. An erroneous interpretation of the Constitution is always important, but some are more damaging than others. The infamous decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, was one —————— Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961) (the exclusionary rule regarding the inadmissibility of evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment applies to the States), overruling Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U.

S., at 562 (Harlan, J., dissenting). It was “egregiously wrong” on the day it was decided, see Ramos, 590 U. S., at ___ (opinion of KAVANAUGH, J.) (slip op., at 7), and as the Solicitor General agreed at oral argument, it should have been overruled at the earliest opportunity, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 92–93. Roe was also egregiously wrong and deeply damaging. For reasons already explained, Roe’s constitutional analysis was far outside the bounds of any reasonable interpretation of the various constitutional provisions to which it vaguely pointed. Roe was on a collision course with the Constitution from the day it was decided, Casey perpetuated its errors, and those errors do not concern some arcane corner of the law of

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court of the United States ruled in the case of Janus v. State, County, and Municipal Employees that the exclusionary rule applies to the States. The Court also ruled that the rule regarding the inadmissibility of evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment applies to the States. In the case of Plessy v. Ferguson, the Court ruled that racial restrictions on the right to vote in primary elections violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In the case of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, the Court ruled that Congress does not have the power to declare substantive rules of common law; a federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction must apply the substantive state law. In each of these cases, the Court overruled a previous decision. In each case, the Court found that the previous decision was egregiously wrong and deeply damaging. The Court in the case of Janus found that the exclusionary rule applies to the States. The rule had been established in the case of Mapp v. Ohio, which held that the rule regarding the inadmissibility of evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment applies to the States. The Court in Janus found that the rule in Mapp was "egregiously wrong" and "deeply damaging." The Court in Plessy found that racial restrictions on the right to vote in primary elections violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court in Plessy found that the decision in Grovey v. Townsend, which had upheld such restrictions, was "egregiously wrong" and "deeply damaging." The Court in Erie found that Congress does not have the power to declare substantive rules of common law; a federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction must apply the substantive state law. The Court in Erie found that the decision in Swift v. Tyson, which had held that Congress does have the power to declare substantive rules of common law, was "egregiously wrong" and "deeply damaging."
