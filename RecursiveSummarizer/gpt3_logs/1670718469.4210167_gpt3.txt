PROMPT:

Write an explanation of the following and how it is a waste of the City's money:


affordable uh...  but essentially moving forward it's going to be unclear whether that's exactly going to be the amount that department of housing is looking at to make areas affordable and what areas they're going to be looking at whether it's going to be whole community areas or smaller locations so we basically took out some of that language that said that it has to be uh...  this forty percent mark because that is not the case under the statute uh...  for the city of chicago under the statute it really is just anything that uh...  the the city declares uh...  by ordinance as a low affordability thank you and this ordinance is specific just to the site and location i think that there will be work ahead to with housing to kind of focus on affordability zones across the city uh...  alderman thank you mister uh...  this uh...  is uh...  i guess fairly unique i know this is not something that we uh...  often delvin but again i do believe it will become more prevalent in time as we uh...  focus on affordability throughout certain communities uh...  the local the location in question uh...  right at thirteen th and haisene sits in the other medical district uh...  the irony of this generally when we look at making adjustments uh...  affordability is not a matter component in this case it is not uh...  the uh...  a little medical district does not have the uh...  ten or twenty percent uh...  numbers that we're normally used to seeing uh...  when we go about with these particular projects so uh...  bring a bring additional affordability to the other medical district and also looking toward uh...  workforce development workforce housing uh...  the affordability is a very key component uh...  given the nature of the uh...  the jobs are in the in the i'm d now we always think of hospitals and in the medical district as people with higher levels of income but the reality is that uh...  you have a lot of support staff and a lot of other uh...  people that help make that


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The city is proposing to spend money on a project that will essentially do nothing to increase affordability in the area. This is a waste of money that could be better spent elsewhere.
