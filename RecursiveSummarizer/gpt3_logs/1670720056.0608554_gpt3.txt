PROMPT:

Write a summary of the following:


conversation is about whether or not a burden imposed on a person is incidental to a content-neutral regulation. The first question is whether or not the person is discriminating based on status. If the answer is yes, then the burden is incidental even if the person thinks it affects them.  The conversation is between Justice Gorsuch and Mr. Fletcher regarding the case of Ms. Smith, a Colorado baker who refused to make a cake for a same-sex wedding. Justice Gorsuch asks whether the outcome would be different if the protected status was changed, and Mr. Fletcher responds that it would still be discrimination. Justice Kavanaugh then asks about a hypothetical in which Muslim filmmakers are required to promote Scientology, and Mr. Fletcher says that it would still be discrimination.  This conversation is about a hypothetical situation in which a writer is being forced to write a speech that violates their deeply held convictions. The question is whether or not this hypothetical situation is the same as the case at hand, in which a speech-writing business is being required to apply a public accommodations law. Fletcher argues that the two situations are not the same, because in the hypothetical situation, the writer is being directly compelled to write something they disagree with, while in the case at hand, the speech-writing business is only being required to follow a content-neutral law.  The speaker argues that speech writers are not likely to be considered public accommodations, and even if they were, a state would have to "wander from" the core public accommodations laws in order to violate the Constitution.  The speaker is discussing a case in which a designer is refusing to create products that implicitly endorse gay marriage. The speaker argues that the designer should be allowed to do this, as long as she is not discriminating based on status.  The Chief Justice and Justice Jackson question the United States' counsel on the issue of compelled speech in the case
