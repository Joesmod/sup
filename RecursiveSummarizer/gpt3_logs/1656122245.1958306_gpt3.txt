and post-viability abortions. The Court in Casey abandoned any reliance on a privacy right and instead grounded the abortion right entirely on the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause. The workability of the "undue burden" test established in Casey v. Jackson Women's Health Organization is called into question. This test, which is used to determine the validity of abortion-related laws, has been criticized for being difficult to understand and apply consistently.  The Supreme Court has ruled that abortion is not a constitutional right, overturning Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood. This does not end debate on the issue, but simply returns it to the people and their elected representatives.  The Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution does not protect a woman's right to an abortion after the point at which all reasonable women will have decided whether to seek one. This new rule, proposed by the concurrence, is not justified by stare decisis and would be fraught with turmoil if adopted.  It is a crime in Michigan, Vermont, and Pennsylvania to administer drugs or use instruments with the intent to procure a miscarriage or abortion, unless it is necessary to save the life of the mother. Punishments vary by state, but can include fines and imprisonment.  The purpose of this article is to outline the various laws in the United States regarding abortion. The punishments for violating these laws range from a few years in prison to fines of up to one thousand dollars.  The Court has ruled that there is no constitutional right to abortion, and that it is up to the people to decide whether or not to outlaw or legalize abortion through the democratic process.  The Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade has been controversial for nearly 50 years, with many Americans and 26 states calling for it to be overturned. In 1992, the Court attempted to find common ground in the abortion debate with the Casey decision, which reaffirmed a woman's right to abortion through viability. However, this has not ended the controversy, and Justice Kavanaugh believes Roe should be overruled. The abortion debate in the United States has been ongoing for many years, with no clear end in sight. In recent years, a number of states have passed laws restricting abortion, which directly conflict with the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade. These laws cannot be dismissed as simply political stunts or as outliers; they represent the sincere beliefs of millions of Americans who believe that allowing abortions up to 24 weeks is too radical and extreme, and does not take into account the state's interest in protecting fetal life. The question of whether or not to overturn Roe v. Wade is not dictated by Casey v. Planned Parenthood alone; other factors must be considered as well. Public opposition to Roe is one such factor. In light of this continued opposition, it is possible that the Supreme Court will overturn Roe in the future.  The Supreme Court has ruled that a
