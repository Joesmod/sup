PROMPT:

Create a concise summary of the following:


form has been published listing those with financial interest in the new property owner.  Valleys is a house card that puts the city at risk.  Their most recent earnings report showed only 600,000 in net earnings in the last quarter and negative earnings over the last four quarters with cash at 164 million and consistently declining.  They have over 3 billion in debt commitments which continue to increase.  This has been their pattern with the consent decree and fines in Rhode Island.  The casino they point to is proof they can handle this project because of their too high debt ratio and putting payouts to shareholders over keeping up their property as well as a bankruptcy in 2009 while under Twin River Twin River and BLB investors names which they blatantly lied about at the last town hall.  As they scrambled to explain their earnings call their cash neither for this project rests upon deals elsewhere that have not yet taken place.  The rest comes from a crowdfunding initiative here which remains without detail.  Financial analysts have downgraded Valleys outlook to negative and their CEO sold nearly half a million dollars in stock this week.  The financial industry and even Valleys own CEO knows they are a bad bet.  Is this really a partner on which we want to stake our future? We want an operator that can't keep up their property, goes bankrupt again, ends up embroiled in consent decrees and fines for failed promises like they have in Rhode Island or even fails to complete the project.  Please don't make getting a supposed achievement before the upcoming election such a high priority but it blows up in your face hurts the city and becomes the weight around your neck for the next election.  Chicago didn't forget the parking meters and we won't forget this.  Please vote no on the please vote no on the Valleys proposal this is your last chance to do the right thing and slow this down to make sure we're being responsible on behalf of all Chicagoans.  Thank you.
