Write a concise summary of the following:


Zunim and CHA? When you go back to labor hours, and you mentioned 10% of the contract value on all contracts are to be with Section 3 businesses, and then 25% of the labor hours are to be with Section 3 businesses.  Are those two in some ways potentially double counted, or are they separate and distinct when you're looking at the business aspect of it, the contract, and then looking at the hours aspect of it from a labor standpoint? So this ensures that at least 10% is spent, of the value of the contract is spent on the Section 3 businesses, and then separately they have the labor hour benchmarks that they have to report.  So it ensures that the Section 3 business is getting at least 10% of the value of that contract, and then the labor hours are counted as 25% of the project's labor hours must be to Section 3 workers or businesses.  Okay, and the changes in the program, for example, many of the callers feel that they have been somewhat shut out of the program.  The changes that you're saying are necessitated by our rules to HUD, how do we either A, fix what existed, or B, help people migrate into what is the current opportunity? Sure, so we've met with some of those callers that called in today.  Some of them are still doing work for us, and they're still contractors for CHA and still earning money on our projects.  So we understand that there was a transition.  So there was outreach to the contractors prior to the procurement, but there have been some difficulties, we'll acknowledge that, and there was a time when there was a slowdown in 2020 for a short period of time due to COVID.  So now we have been reaching out to folks, our work office has been doing constant public engagement events to make sure that folks understand these changes, but also understand that the opportunities for Section 3 businesses do not only lie with our job order contract initiatives.  We have Section 3 opportunities throughout all of our contracting operations.  And so the pre-qualified


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) has a program in place that ensures that at least 10% of the value of all contracts goes to businesses registered under Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act. Additionally, 25% of all labor hours on CHA projects must be carried out by Section 3 businesses. There have been some complaints from contractors about the program, but CHA has been working to reach out to those affected and help them transition into the new system.
