PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


90 seconds here so number one I really appreciate the work that we're doing to expand the care teams, I know it's going to be data driven.  I'll be following up with Matt Richards.  I have a firm belief that anyone, regardless of the need of the community anyone experiencing a mental health crisis should receive a mental health treatment response so I know that we're going to work on that and I'll follow up on that.  Sometimes I know Chair you like to tick off the box and how many people have said it so let's add one more voice to the chorus and 2020 Alderman Martin and others in committee put forward the resolution that we were having a climate crisis it wasn't a problem, it was a challenge, it was a crisis.  And then in January of 2021.  We requested a study looking at what a department of the environment would look like and we are just past two years there and so much of the work that has happened is laudable and I don't deny that 188 million in environmental assistance sustainability investments.  The decarbonization plan is great, the climate action plan is great.  It deserves a department.  It deserves a department that I appreciate what we are doing here but I, the things that we call offices in the city of Chicago never build out beyond that stature.  I would be fine starting with this head count, I would be fine.  I don't have the power to do this, but I would be fine if we recess we control F office to department reprinted this piece of paper and gave us this fledgling department that we could all feel really good about voting on, and then have a study that built that up over the next year, you're going to have a lot of colleagues, hopefully here for another term really excited to do that work.  But that is a place that I could feel really proud of starting out, and that is all I have to say on that.  Thank you all the men with spotter.  Is there a motion to recommend approval of item seven and seven be on the agenda.  Alderman Riley is.  Yes.  Okay, roll
