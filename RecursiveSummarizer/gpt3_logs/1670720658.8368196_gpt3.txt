PROMPT:

Write out the proposed spending as a dollar amount and what the spending is for of the following:


pool work or temporary work, how are you going to admit to that.  What we are trying to get towards is a labor pool, so that it is you know there are people that are available to do this and work with streets and sanitation.  But that's, but you're going to hire them, essentially full time for those periods or yes.  So you know what you see here is budgeted by hours and so we are working, I think, speaking with the Commissioner we want to get these in place by April, I believe is what we're aiming for.  Okay, and currently you have the amount in the budget I think was 26,000 hours as part of the initial budget.  What is that is does that amount exists currently in fiscal 22.  Yes, I can't, I would have to check if we update a little bit, but this is a increase above that so let me get back to you to make sure that that's what's in this year's budget.  Okay.  All right, thank you very much.  Also on the Office of Climate and Environmental Equity.  I definitely agree that it is an appropriate move.  But not at the full department which I think some of us would definitely like to like to see.  I do understand the desire to walk prudently in this particular process and get to where, where we I think ultimately will get to have a full blown department and I do agree with all of them Riley, write that down that when this did happen back and was at 2011 when, when they removed the Department of Environment wasn't the best moving, you know, bifurcating all of those responsibilities, and I think bringing these things back together.  Now with this department or this, this office have enforcement authority.  Right now this office is more on the policy and planning side the enforcement authority believes sits with Department of Public Health, Health and Buildings.  Okay.  And so that's the step one, and then step two is to bring the enforcement aspect.  And that's what we're going to look at over this next year is really look at all the different roles, kind of who owns that
