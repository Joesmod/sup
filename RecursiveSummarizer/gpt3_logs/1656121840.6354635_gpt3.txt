the past 25 years. See Brief for International and Comparative Legal Scholars as Amici Curiae 2829. In light of that worldwide liberalization of abortion laws, it is American States that will become international outliers after today. In sum, the majority can point to neither legal nor factual developments in support of its decision. Nothing that has happened in this country or the world in recent decades undermines the core insight of Roe and Casey. It continues to be true that, within the constraints those decisions established, a woman, not the government, should choose whether she will bear the burdens of pregnancy, childbirth, and parenting. 2 In support of its holding, see ante, at 40, the majority invokes two watershed cases overruling prior constitutional precedents: West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish and Brown v. Board of Education. But those decisions, unlike todays, responded to changed law and to changed facts and attitudes that had taken hold throughout society. As Casey recognized, the two cases are relevant only to showby stark contrasthow unjustified overturning the right to choose is. See 505 U. S., at 861864. West Coast Hotel overruled Adkins v. Childrens Hospital  21See D. Grossman, K. Grindlay, & B.

Adkins had found a state minimum-wage law unconstitutional because, in the Courts view, the law interfered with a constitutional right to contract. 261 U. S., at 554555. But then the Great Depression hit, bringing with it unparalleled economic despair. The experience underminedin fact, it disprovedAdkinss assumption that a wholly unregulated market could meet basic human needs. As Justice Jackson (before becoming a Justice) wrote of that time: The older world of laissez faire was recognized everywhere outside the Court to be dead. The Struggle for Judicial Supremacy 85 (1941). In West Coast Hotel, the Court caught up, recognizing through the lens of experience the flaws of existing legal doctrine. See also ante, at 11 (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment). The havoc the Depression had worked on ordinary Americans, the Court noted, was common knowledge through the length and breadth of the land. 300 U. S., at 399. The laissez-faire approach had led to the exploiting of workers at wages so low as to be insufficient to meet the bare cost of living. Ibid. And since Adkins was decided, the law had also changed. In several decisions, the Court had started to recognize the power of States to implement economic policies designed to enhance their citizens economic well-being. See, e.g., Nebbia v. New York, 291 U. S. 502 (1934); OGorman & Young, Inc. v. Hartford Fire

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

In the past 25 years, abortion laws have been liberalized worldwide. American States will become international outliers after today. The majority can point to neither legal nor factual developments in support of its decision. Roe and Casey continue to be accurate in their assessment that a woman, not the government, should choose whether she will bear the burdens of pregnancy, childbirth, and parenting.
