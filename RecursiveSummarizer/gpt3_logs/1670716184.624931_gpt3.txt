they're going on to a platform they're going on to a legally licensed platform does that help you no and if it's if it's a small company if it's it's if it's hariston uh hariston and company and let's say you have 10 um properties i want to she's not talking about a company she's talking about an individual who has a two flat and she wants to rent out or a three flat whatever right oh then then i don't believe if it's just you and your you yourself would not this is only for platforms this is for people going on the world the world like like amaria like all the other companies are out there right now they're now licensed okay no i i that is not my issue my issue is with the average resident that might have a two flat that they are renting out that unit to a student whose semester is only seven months or i'm here to i'm visiting i'm doing a summer school program i'm here for three months that would be considered short term rental and would they have to provide the fee and and all it does is all i'm asking is that because as it stands now they would be included and i may because they're they're international students i use the university of chicago for example for example um they they may advertise this but we we are not a a big company so i i want residents i want there to be some consideration for the single person that is not in the business like these others for just one unit or two units that would just be the the usual 125 registration fee per that individual unit why do they why do they because we brought in because remember remember a couple years ago the individual unit owners only registered with the companies and back then we we it was just chaos we didn't know the companies were now reporting to the city of chicago so we as a department brought in all of the various individual registrations from all the various platforms for instance airbnb when they register with us bacp that host the actual property owner the renter pays us 125 and they can do whatever


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The city of Chicago requires that all short-term rental platforms be licensed, and that all hosts be registered with the city. Hosts are required to pay a registration fee of 125 per unit. The city is considering exempting individual hosts with only one or two units from this requirement.
