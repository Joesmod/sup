Write a concise summary of the following:


because I didn't know we did not do that in this situation.  Okay, well I'm in support of the land sale to the church.  They are a long time church in the community.  They provide public service to the community.  And so they're deserving of acquiring property they've been there for a very long time.  And I think, you know, I think this is a reflection of the need for the department, as with many issues, the, the, the allocation of tip dollars or percentages for the towards a particular tip development, where there's a need for the city to come up with some policies related to, you know, how churches not the profits, get breaks on on the land sale we're selling land to a multi million dollar health company for a dollar, you know, I mean a building and church, a small church it as a matter of fact, that serves the community as well is asked to pay fair market value.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Thank you all them and all the mold and I'll follow up on all of them and Lopez.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.  I have a question about the inability by the city, according to Mr chant on to sell to churches properties for a dollar.  Do I do remember doing the at least going back to the daily administration.  I do remember them in my ward.  I do remember that program back then.  I do not.  Can you please look into that because I think it will contradict what you just represented to all them and down.  And maybe because these churches may have had a non for profit, and under the non for profit they had acquire these lots for a dollar, or maybe not, I think it would be good to find out and get to the bottom of at least this question I think because if there is a precedent.  I don't see why that change in policy that you just represented to all them and down.  Thank you, Mr.  Thank you, Mr Chairman.  Thank you.  Thank you, Mr.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  Thank you.  Thank you chairman, and I want to just echo if I may.  I think that's a question that I think that we're going to be asking


CONCISE SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

The city is selling land to a church for a dollar. The councilmember supports this because the church provides public service to the community. However, another councilmember questions whether the city has a policy of selling land to churches for a dollar, and asks that the matter be looked into.
