Write a concise summary of the following:

see id., at 1039 (THOMAS, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).  28 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court late 18th and early 19th century did not criminalize prequickening abortions does not mean that anyone thought the States lacked the authority to do so. When legislatures began to exercise that authority as the century wore on, no one, as far as we are aware, argued that the laws they enacted violated a fundamental right. That is not surprising since common-law authorities had repeatedly condemned abortion and described it as an unlawful act without regard to whether it occurred before or after quickening. See supra, at 1621. Another amicus brief relied upon by respondents (see Brief for Respondents 21) tries to dismiss the significance of the state criminal statutes that were in effect when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted by suggesting that they were enacted for illegitimate reasons. According to this account, which is based almost entirely on statements made by one prominent proponent of the statutes, important motives for the laws were the fear that Catholic immigrants were having more babies than Protestants and that the availability of abortion was leading White Protestant women to shir[k their] maternal duties. Brief for American Historical Association et al. as Amici Curiae 20. Resort to this argument is a testament to the lack of any real historical support for the right that Roe and Casey recognized. This Court has long disfavored arguments based on alleged legislative motives. See, e.g., Erie v. Paps A. M., 529 U. S. 277, 292 (2000) (plurality opinion); Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U. S. 622, 652 (1994); United States v. OBrien, 391 U. S. 367, 383 (1968); Arizona v. California, 283 U. S. 423, 455 (1931) (collecting cases). The Court has recognized that inquiries into legislative motives are a hazardous matter. OBrien, 391 U. S., at 383. Even when an argument about legislative motive is backed by statements made by legislators who voted for a law, we  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 29 Opinion of the Court have been reluctant to attribute those motives to the legislative body as a whole. What motivates one legislator to make a speech about a statute is not necessarily what motivates scores of others to enact it. Id., at 384. Here, the argument about legislative motive is not even based on statements by legislators, but on statements made by a few supporters of the new 19th-century abortion laws, and it is quite a leap to attribute these motives to all the legislators whose votes were responsible for the enactment of those laws. Recall that at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, over three-quarters of the States had adopted statutes criminalizing abortion (usually at all stages of pregnancy), and that from the early 20th century until the day Roe was handed down, every single State had such a law on its books. Are we to believe that the hundreds of

RESPONSE:

The argument that the 19th century abortion laws were motivated by a fear of Catholic immigrants and that White Protestant women were shirking their maternal duties is not supported by any real historical evidence.
