Write a concise summary of the following:

conspicuously   56 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court failed to say that they agreed with the viability rule; instead, they candidly acknowledged the reservations [some] of us may have in reaffirming [that] holding of Roe. Id., at 853. The controlling opinion criticized and rejected Roes trimester scheme, 505 U. S., at 872, and substituted a new undue burden test, but the basis for this test was obscure. And as we will explain, the test is full of ambiguities and is difficult to apply.  Casey, in short, either refused to reaffirm or rejected important aspects of Roes analysis, failed to remedy glaring deficiencies in Roes reasoning, endorsed what it termed Roes central holding while suggesting that a majority might not have thought it was correct, provided no new support for the abortion right other than Roes status as precedent, and imposed a new and problematic test with no firm grounding in constitutional text, history, or precedent. As discussed below, Casey also deployed a novel version of the doctrine of stare decisis. See infra, at 6469. This new doctrine did not account for the profound wrongness of the decision in Roe, and placed great weight on an intangible form of reliance with little if any basis in prior case law. Stare decisis does not command the preservation of such a decision. C Workability. Our precedents counsel that another important consideration in deciding whether a precedent should be overruled is whether the rule it imposes is workablethat is, whether it can be understood and applied in a consistent and predictable manner. Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. 778, 792 (2009); Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 173 (1989); Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., 485 U. S. 271, 283284 (1988). Caseys undue burden test has scored poorly on the workability scale.  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 57 Opinion of the Court 1 Problems begin with the very concept of an undue burden. As Justice Scalia noted in his Casey partial dissent, determining whether a burden is due or undue is inherently standardless. 505 U. S., at 992; see also June Medical Services L. L. C. v. Russo, 591 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (GORSUCH, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 17) ([W]hether a burden is deemed undue depends heavily on which factors the judge considers and how much weight he accords each of them (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted)). The Casey plurality tried to put meaning into the undue burden test by setting out three subsidiary rules, but these rules created their own problems. The first rule is that a provision of law is invalid, if its purpose or effect is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability. 505 U. S., at 878 (emphasis added); see also id., at 877. But whether a particular obstacle qualifies as substantial is often open to reasonable debate. In the sense relevant here, substantial

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The workability of the "undue burden" test established in Casey v. Jackson Women's Health Organization is called into question. This test, which is used to determine the validity of abortion-related laws, has been criticized for being difficult to understand and apply consistently.
