PROMPT:

Write an explanation of the following and how it is a waste of the City's money:

That project came a step closer to completion with the council's April 27th designation of the O'Hara community area of Chicago's first low affordability community area under the Illinois affordable housing special assessment program.  The availability of this tax break was a major and a key factor in the council's approval in the December 21 approval of the apartment complex to 81st and Higgins and to qualify for the reduction developer Glen star agreed to double the percentage of affordable units that would otherwise have been required by the ARO.  That completes my testimony in the court earlier report.  I'm available for any questions.  Thank you very much for your time.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you for your presentation.

It's not a little bit better than the federal government has got other cities money when they're unable to spend on time.  Phenomenal work.  Phenomenal work.  Please pass it on to the entire team.  One of the slides you had was about a collaboration with U of C and housing to talk about increasing wealth in marginalized communities.  Is that ongoing work or is that an upcoming event? I believe that's ongoing work.  I understand it's multiple cities and designations looking at that work.  There's a team associated with studying that and that it resolved in a report that will then also have a symposium.  So I can get the date on the symposium and everything.  The date would be great but I would also ask that there might be some members of the housing and real estate committee would like to be a


CONCISE SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

The city council is wasting money by giving a tax break to a developer who agreed to double the percentage of affordable units that would otherwise have been required by the ARO.
