Write a concise summary of the following:

Constitution is written in such a way that it can adapt to changing circumstances over time. This has allowed the Constitution to protect women's rights, even though it did not do so in 1868. The Constitution subjects discrimination against women to heightened judicial scrutiny and guarantees access to contraception. The Founders knew that the world would change over time, so they wrote the Constitution in general terms, rather than defining rights by reference to specific practices of the time.  The Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) held that the right to marry is a fundamental right guaranteed by the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court also held that states may not ban same-sex marriage or refuse to recognize valid marriages from other jurisdictions. In his dissent, Justice Breyer argues that the Court's ruling improperly expands the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment without any clear guidance on what other rights might be included. He also argues that the Court is effectively "picking and choosing" which rights to protect, based on individual preferences, rather than following a consistent constitutional principle.  The majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization overrules Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood, effectively eliminating the constitutional right to abortion. The opinion relies on the premise that the right to abortion is not constitutionally protected because it was not recognized as such in 1868 when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified. This logic is problematic because it would also preclude the recognition of other rights that were not recognized in the 19th century, such as the right to marry someone of another race. In addition, the majority opinion provides no justification for overruling Roe and Casey other than the fact that abortion was not recognized as a constitutional right in 1868.  The Supreme Court's precedents on bodily autonomy, sexual and familial relations, and procreation are all interrelated and protect a woman's right to self-determination. Justice Kavanaugh's argument that the Court should be neutral on the issue of abortion by allowing the states to decide is incorrect. The Court is not being neutral when it eliminates a woman's right to choose.  The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that every adult has the right to determine what shall be done with their own body, including medical decisions or procedures. This right extends to women, who have the right to choose whether or not to have an abortion.  The Court has a history of expanding the sphere of protected liberty to groups that were previously excluded. In Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Court extended constitutional protection to women's reproductive rights. The Court has continued in this vein, most recently with Obergefell v. Hodges, which extended the right to marry to same-sex couples. The majority in the present case fails to recognize that
