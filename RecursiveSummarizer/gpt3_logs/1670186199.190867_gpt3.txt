PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


fourth team on the west side focused on substance use that will that will include a community paramedic and appear recovery specialist so that's the first thing that's happening.  And that is already in the works and being planned.  Then the next thing that will be happening will be together we're looking at both adding second shifts.  There are union negotiations and other things that go into doing that.  And then we've, we pulled data to identify the parts of the city, where the needs are greatest and we'll be looking to add additional teams there so it's it's happening really in stages, every time we add a new response or a new, a new type like the substance use that requires the state giving approval the sign off with 911, etc.  But that's, that's the, that's the plan sort of over this next year.  And what, how much will that cost.  We have $15 million 15 million additional dollars.  Right, but that's, you said that's over a couple years so how much for the next year, that's because it's Chicago rescue plan funding.  So, we are, of course, wanting to make sure that as we build things they can be sustained.  So, some of that is built is, you know, doing things like buying the vehicles and those fixed costs.  Some of those are staffing and again that gets into CD pH has funding to for example, I know my time is short but yeah, these the allocation I guess for this year is just what I want to know that's it, it was it's not in the amendment, it's in the original, and it's it's the whole 15 million is allocated.  We don't spend it, it'll roll over because it is funded through the AARP, or the AARP fund specifically which goes till 2026.  Okay.  And, and my last line is just around the lead line replacement.  How much in the budget is allocated for for that this year.  I will have to get that number for the whole program, I will have to so there's a mix of what's in the actual water department budget as well as what we brought before the, the finance committee
