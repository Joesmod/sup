The District Court ruled in favor of the clinic and doctor, and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that ruling. The Supreme Court then agreed to hear the case. In its ruling, the Supreme Court said that Roe and its progeny, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, were "wrongly decided" and that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion.
