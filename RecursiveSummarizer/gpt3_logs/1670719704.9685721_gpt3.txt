Write a summary of the following conversation:


Lilly and Luke, November 20, you're invited. And it says Lilly and Luke and the date and place, the town. The Exhibit 52 is counting down the days. It doesn't even say what it's counting down for, except "our special day," which everybody has to assume is the couple's. Fifty-three is an RSVP with pictures. Fifty-four is "Our Blog, Bring Your Dancing Shoes." Fifty-five is their date, "It all began Heritage Reporting Corporation                           1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 117 Official - Subject to Final Review  seven years ago," Lilly's version and Luke's  version. It's clearly not 303's version. "We  love each other and coffee" -- I don't even know  what CO -- "Colorado, Jesus, dogs, and diving. We love each other" is the couple who loves  Jesus. I assume your adversary won't say Jesus doesn't love them back, but it doesn't say that.  The 57 is the ceremony. Fifty-eight is the reception, location, spirits, dinner menu and dancing. Fifty-nine is location. I don't see anywhere I'm celebrating the marriage or God loves anyone or anything to do with anything like that. So have you reviewed this website? MR. FLETCHER: I have, Justice Sotomayor. JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: Do you believe that there's any page that says celebrate the marriage? MR. FLETCHER: I -- honestly, to -- as I stand here today, I can't remember whether there is or not. I don't think it would make a difference if there were. And I think what the examples that you just read highlight is that there is a lot of websites or content on websites that is properly within this case Heritage Reporting Corporation                           1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 118 Official - Subject to Final Review  because it is consistent with the stipulations Justice Gorsuch and with the scope of relief that they're asking for and with the type of services that Ms. Waggoner has described this  morning.  JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: What they're  asking
