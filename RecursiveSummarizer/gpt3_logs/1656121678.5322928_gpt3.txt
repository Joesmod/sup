more than 20 Justices of this Court have now  12 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION KAVANAUGH, J., concurring grappled with the divisive issue of abortion. I greatly respect all of the Justices, past and present, who have done so. Amidst extraordinary controversy and challenges, all of them have addressed the abortion issue in good faith after careful deliberation, and based on their sincere understandings of the Constitution and of precedent. I have endeavored to do the same. In my judgment, on the issue of abortion, the Constitution is neither pro-life nor pro-choice. The Constitution is neutral, and this Court likewise must be scrupulously neutral. The Court today properly heeds the constitutional principle of judicial neutrality and returns the issue of abortion to the people and their elected representatives in the democratic process.

In urging our review, Mississippi stated that its case was an ideal vehicle to reconsider the bright-line viability rule, and that a judgment in its favor would not require the Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833 (1992). Pet. for Cert. 5. Today, the Court nonetheless rules for Mississippi by doing just that. I would take a more measured course. I agree with the Court that the viability line established by Roe and Casey should be discarded under a straightforward stare decisis analysis. That line never made any sense. Our abortion precedents describe the right at issue as a womans right to choose to terminate her pregnancy. That right should therefore extend far enough to ensure a reasonable opportunity to choose, but need not extend any further ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment   2 DOBBS v.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

This case concerns a Mississippi law that generally prohibits abortion after the fifteenth week of pregnancy. The Supreme Court has ruled that the law is constitutional, overturning the previous bright-line viability rule established by Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey. Chief Justice Roberts, concurring in the judgment, agrees that the previous rule should be discarded but takes a more measured approach, stating that the right to choose to terminate a pregnancy should extend only far enough to ensure a reasonable opportunity to choose, and not all the way to viability.
