discovered by six weeks of gestation). I see no sound basis for questioning the adequacy of that opportunity. But that is all I would say, out of adherence to a simple yet fundamental principle of judicial restraint: If it is not necessary to decide more to dispose of a case, then it is necessary not to decide more. Perhaps we are not always perfect in following that command, and certainly there are cases that warrant an exception. But this is not one of them. Surely we should adhere closely to principles of judicial restraint here, where the broader path the Court chooses entails repudiating a constitutional right we have not only previously recognized, but also expressly reaffirmed applying the doctrine of stare decisis. The Courts opinion is thoughtful and thorough, but those virtues cannot compensate for the fact that its dramatic and consequential ruling is unnecessary to decide the case before us. I Let me begin with my agreement with the Court, on the only question we need decide here: whether to retain the rule from Roe and Casey that a womans right to terminate her pregnancy extends up to the point that the fetus is regarded as viable outside the womb. I agree that this rule should be discarded. First, this Court seriously erred in Roe in adopting viability as the earliest point at which a State may legislate to advance its substantial interests in the area of abortion. See ante, at 5053. Roe set forth a rigid three-part framework anchored to viability, which more closely resembled a regulatory code than a body of constitutional law. That  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 3 ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment framework, moreover, came out of thin air. Neither the Texas statute challenged in Roe nor the Georgia statute at issue in its companion case, Doe v. Bolton, 410 U. S. 179 (1973), included any gestational age limit. No party or amicus asked the Court to adopt a bright line viability rule. And as for Casey, arguments for or against the viability rule played only a de minimis role in the parties briefing and in the oral argument. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 1718, 51 (fleeting discussion of the viability rule). It is thus hardly surprising that neither Roe nor Casey made a persuasive or even colorable argument for why the time for terminating a pregnancy must extend to viability. The Courts jurisprudence on this issue is a textbook illustration of the perils of deciding a question neither presented nor briefed. As has been often noted, Roes defense of the line boiled down to the circular assertion that the States interest is compelling only when an unborn child can live outside the womb, because that is when the unborn child can live outside the womb. See 410 U. S., at 163164; see also J. Ely, The Wages of Crying Wolf: A Comment on Roe v. Wade, 82 Yale L. J. 920, 924 (1973) (Roes reasoning mistake[s] a definition for a syllogism).

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court has ruled that a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy extends up to the point that the fetus is regarded as viable outside the womb. This ruling overturns the previous rule from Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood, which had anchored a woman's right to abortion to viability. The new ruling is based on the principle of judicial restraint, and the Court has acknowledged that it erred in Roe in adopting viability as the earliest point at which a State may legislate to advance its interests in the area of abortion.
