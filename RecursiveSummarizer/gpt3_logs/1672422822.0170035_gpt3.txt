Chairman.  Just a quick note.  I don't know, I understand that there's a problem with what my colleagues say with respect to tax ID numbers, et cetera.  The city can resolve that.

And congratulations.  Thank you so much.

This transfers or supplies needed as committee meetings are now being held in person.  I don't believe Alderman Harris is here to address the committee.  Is there is she here? First, Alderman Harris, we will count you in for quorum and then would ask if you could
