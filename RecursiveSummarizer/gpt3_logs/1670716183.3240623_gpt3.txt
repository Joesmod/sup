RESPONSE:

The city of Chicago is proposing a new fee for companies that offer short-term rentals, such as Airbnb. The fee would be $250 for the company, plus $60 for each rental unit. This would apply to any company that offers short-term rentals, regardless of the number of units they have available. The city is hoping to generate revenue from this new fee, as well as to ensure that all companies offering short-term rentals are registered and following the proper procedures.
