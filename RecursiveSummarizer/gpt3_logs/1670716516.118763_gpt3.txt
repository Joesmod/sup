Write a concise summary of the following:


contractors so we can work directly with them.  And then, you know, take whatever we were spending on that contractor to make sure we were reinvesting it back into our portfolio.  Does that answer your question, Chairman Dahl? Oh, I was just asking, are they doing that? Have they, how much were they spending on the third party contractor? And is that being reinvested back into the staffing for the section three program within CHA? Yeah, so go ahead.  I'd say, so the contract costs about $3 million a year over four years.  So it's a $12 million cost to CHA.  So now that money is now driven to our program.  So, 12 million dollar contract is what the third party administrator was doing, is that correct? Yes, and their contract ended in 2020.  Okay.  Their contract ended in, it coincided with the implementation of the new rules.  Okay, all right.  Thank you, thank you much.  Again, I appreciate everyone joining us here on today.  I think we had a lot of good information.  I think we've got some additional information that you know, chew on on this particular item.  And I think that, again, the information and it was good and hopefully we can find ways to diversify the pool of individuals that are being utilized for this.  So again, if there are no further questions on this, I wanna thank everybody for joining us this afternoon and actually making this a fairly informative hearing for us and again, committee, please put your seatbelts on.  We've got a lot of work to do in this space as it relates to contracts and equity for citizens of the city.  So I know we've got some other items that are in committee.  We will be working to get those matters heard and get them out as necessary.  So just please bear with me as we make this through a new journey for me.  So please just bear with me.  If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out so we can try to move some of these things forward.  Any questions? Any additional questions before we go? All right.  And there
