CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

This section amends the Internal Revenue Code to provide a tax credit for the production of clean transportation fuels. The credit is equal to the applicable amount per gallon (or gallon equivalent) of fuel produced, multiplied by the emissions factor for the fuel. The applicable amount is 20 cents per gallon for most fuels, but is $1.00 per gallon for fuels produced at qualified facilities that meet certain requirements. For sustainable aviation fuels, the credit is increased to 50 cents per gallon.
