PROMPT:

Write an explanation of the following and how it is a waste of the City's money:


right, when we have empty churches.  Is there any plans, you know, into using those assets, right? I'm really welcome the housing department support to develop affordable housing on 19th Ampeoria.  I think that's going to be a great project.  I appreciate the partnership.  Anything in terms of how do we scale up, right, or 2,800 to, I know some of the estimates put the need in somewhere around 100,000 units, right, in the city of Chicago.  How we can scale up looking from within, how we can get the most out of, you know, our investments.  So, no, Alderman, I do appreciate the question, and I kind of hear two questions in that, if you don't mind, you know, how can we assist with assets or empty facilities, and then the additional is how do we scale up? And so, in one essence, you know, we work with the Department of Planning, we work with AAS, we're always looking for new opportunities, and I really relish the opportunities where Alderman are saying, here's stuff in our neighborhoods, because a lot of times we just don't know.  And so, when we find out something sells and we didn't know, that's a little bit bothersome.  And so, it's great to be with Alderman who are thinking about housing first a lot, and so, often, it's the Alderman reaches out and says, I have a ward lot, I have a something, can we do something with this? Those phone calls are very welcomed, and the more that they continue, the more helpful we can try to be on that.  But those sites often represent older buildings or buildings with, like, some sort of environmental issues or remediation causes, and what we're finding, just like we saw earlier, is we have to scale up, we have to think about scaling up in size.  You know, we're looking at economies of scale as issues at this point, and so, our normal building type for multifamily rentals, when I started, was around between 40 and 60 units, and we're really moving that needle up to, like, 80 or plus, 80 to 100, and it's a function of, once we build


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The city is wasting money by not using empty churches for affordable housing. Alderman are not aware of the problem and the city needs to scale up its efforts to address the issue.
