CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The conversation is about whether a website designer can refuse to design a website for a same-sex couple on the basis of her religious beliefs. The Supreme Court has already recognized that there is a difference of opinion on the issue of marriage, and the designer is arguing that she should not be required to express a view that violates her conscience. Justice Kagan points out that the refusal is not based on the content of the speech, but on the fact that the couple is same-sex.
