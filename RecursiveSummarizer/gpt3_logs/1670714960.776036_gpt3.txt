Write a concise summary of the following:


is not to penalize anybody but to ensure that we share the wealth and that we're all inclusive, that calculation is 1.20% of the goal.  So let's say for a million dollars that can be, and let's say they're 1% away from the goal, that can be $500.  The 1.20% is the penalty.  Correct.  So in the case of, so if they don't meet the goal again, it's 1.20% is what is paid.  In the year we did $128,000 in fines, that would, that is my math, that's almost a billion dollars worth of work.  So those, the 128 was what we collected in total as part of that penalty.  And that was before we made the change to provide that data to vendor.  And that in 2021 was only 23,000 miles.  So a 20th of 1% according to the 128,000 was $256 million worth of work that that didn't hit on.  And you all did to your credit, push that number down to $23,000 the following year, which would have been about $46 million worth of work.  So I think that's a very good progress you guys are making, but I would question the amount of the penalty for not meeting the requirement.  So we'll call it ultimate vast scales.  Thank you chairman, and my apologies if some of the questions might have already been answered.  So in looking at the draft of the ordinance, it appears that the project area parts being removed and the other socially economic disadvantage areas being replacing that, is that the intent? Yes.  Yes.  Yep.  For the SEDA, has there been a racial breakdown of the areas as far as what's Latino, what's black, Asian and such? The area, I think planning should have that dotted census data, and if it's not, we can make sure that you get it through the chair if they don't have that broken down right now.  Yeah, I apologize Alderman, but I don't have that data in front of me right now.  Okay, we'll respond to the chair.  I would love that.  The reason I asked that is the difference between your project area and socioeconomically disadvantaged area could lead to a scenario where the folks who were hiring
