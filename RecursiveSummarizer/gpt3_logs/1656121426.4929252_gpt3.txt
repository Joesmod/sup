Casey, 505 U. S., at 851. Those criteria, at a high level of generality, could license fundamental rights to illicit drug use, prostitution, and the like. See Compassion in Dying v. Washington, 85 F. 3d 1440, 1444 (CA9 1996) (OScannlain, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). None of these rights has any claim to being deeply rooted in history. Id., at 1440, 1445. What sharply distinguishes the abortion right from the rights recognized in the cases on which Roe and Casey rely is something that both those decisions acknowledged: Abortion destroys what those decisions call potential life and what the law at issue in this case regards as the life of an unborn human being. See Roe, 410 U. S., at 159 (abortion is inherently different); Casey, 505 U. S., at 852 (abortion is a unique act). None of the other decisions cited by Roe and Casey involved the critical moral question posed by abortion. They are therefore inapposite. They do not support the right to obtain an abortion, and by the same token, our conclusion that the Constitution does not confer such a right does not undermine them in any way. 2 In drawing this critical distinction between the abortion right and other rights, it is not necessary to dispute Caseys claim (which we accept for the sake of argument) that the Cite as: 597 U.

S., at 848. Abortion is nothing new. It has been addressed by lawmakers for centuries, and the fundamental moral question that it poses is ageless.  Defenders of Roe and Casey do not claim that any new scientific learning calls for a different answer to the underlying moral question, but they do contend that changes in society require the recognition of a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. Without the availability of abortion, they maintain, people will be inhibited from exercising their freedom to choose the types of relationships they desire, and women will be unable to compete with men in the workplace and in other endeavors.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey considered the constitutionality of abortion and ultimately upheld the right to abortion. However, the Court also recognized that abortion is a unique act that destroys potential life. This recognition distinguishes the abortion right from other rights that have been recognized by the Court.
