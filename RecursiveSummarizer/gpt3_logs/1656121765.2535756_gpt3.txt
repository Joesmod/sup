PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:

nothing to do with each other, or with the right to terminate an early pregnancy. See ante, at 3132 (asserting that recognizing a relationship among them, as addressing aspects of personal autonomy, would ineluctably license fundamental rights to illegal drug use [and] prostitution). But that is flat wrong. The Courts precedents about bodily autonomy, sexual and familial relations, and procreation are all interwovenall part of the fabric of our constitutional law, and because that is so, of our lives. Especially womens lives, where they safeguard a right to self-determination. And eliminating that right, we need to say before further describing our precedents, is not taking a neutral position, as JUSTICE KAVANAUGH tries to argue. Ante, at 23, 5, 7, 1112 (concurring opinion). His idea is that neutrality lies in giving the abortion issue to the States, where some can go one way and some another. But would he say that the Court is being scrupulously neutral if it allowed New York and California to ban all the guns they want? Ante, at 3. If the Court allowed some States to use unanimous juries and others not? If the Court told the States: Decide for yourselves whether to put restrictions on church attendance? We could go onand in fact we will. Suppose JUSTICE KAVANAUGH were to say (in line with the majority opinion) that the rights we just listed are more textually or historically grounded than the right to choose. What, then, of the right to contraception or same-sex marriage? Would it be scrupulously neutral for the Court to eliminate those rights too? The point of all these examples is that when it comes to rights, the Court does not act neutrally when it leaves everything up to the States. Rather, the Court acts neutrally when it protects the right against all comers. And to apply that point to the case here: When the Court decimates a right women have held for 50 years, the Court is Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 21 BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting not being scrupulously neutral. It is instead taking sides: against women who wish to exercise the right, and for States (like Mississippi) that want to bar them from doing so. JUSTICE KAVANAUGH cannot obscure that point by appropriating the rhetoric of even-handedness. His position just is what it is: A brook-no-compromise refusal to recognize a womans right to choose, from the first day of a pregnancy. And that position, as we will now show, cannot be squared with this Courts longstanding view that women indeed have rights (whatever the state of the world in 1868) to make the most personal and consequential decisions about their bodies and their lives. Consider first, then, the line of this Courts cases protecting bodily integrity. Casey, 505 U. S., at 849. No right, in this Courts time-honored view, is held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded, than the right of every individual to the possession and control of his own person. Union Pacific R.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court's precedents on bodily autonomy, sexual and familial relations, and procreation are all interrelated and protect a woman's right to self-determination. Justice Kavanaugh's argument that the Court should be neutral on the issue of abortion by allowing the states to decide is incorrect. The Court is not being neutral when it eliminates a woman's right to choose.
