PROMPT:

Write a detailed summary of the following:

contraception. Over the course of three cases, the Court had held that a right to use and gain access to contraception was part of the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of liberty. See Griswold, 381 U. S. 479; Eisenstadt, 405 U. S. 438; Carey v. Population Services Int’l, 431 U. S. 678 (1977). That clause, we explained, necessarily conferred a right “to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child.” Eisenstadt, 405 U. S., at 453; see Carey, 431 U. S., at 684–685. Casey saw Roe as of a piece: In “critical respects the abortion decision is of the same character.” 505 U. S., at 852. “[R]easonable people,” the Court noted, could also oppose contraception; and indeed, they could believe that “some forms of contraception” similarly implicate a concern with “potential life.” Id., at 853, 859. Yet the views of others could not automatically prevail against a woman’s right to control her own body and make her own choice about whether to bear, and probably to raise, a child. When an unplanned pregnancy is involved— because either contraception or abortion is outlawed—“the liberty of the woman is at stake in a sense unique to the human condition.” Id., at 852. No State could undertake to resolve the moral questions raised “in such a definitive way” as to deprive a woman of all choice. Id., at 850. Faced with all these connections between Roe/Casey and judicial decisions recognizing other constitutional rights, Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 25 BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting the majority tells everyone not to worry. It can (so it says) neatly extract the right to choose from the constitutional edifice without affecting any associated rights. (Think of someone telling you that the Jenga tower simply will not collapse.) Today’s decision, the majority first says, “does not undermine” the decisions cited by Roe and Casey—the ones involving “marriage, procreation, contraception, [and] family relationships”—“in any way.” Ante, at 32; Casey, 505 U. S., at 851. Note that this first assurance does not extend to rights recognized after Roe and Casey, and partly based on them—in particular, rights to same-sex intimacy and marriage. See supra, at 23.6 On its later tries, though, the majority includes those too: “Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion.” Ante, at 66; see ante, at 71–72. That right is unique, the majority asserts, “because [abortion] terminates life or potential life.” Ante, at 66 (internal quotation marks omitted); see ante, at 32, 71–72. So the majority depicts today’s decision as “a restricted railroad ticket, good for this day and train only.” Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649, 669 (1944) (Roberts, J., dissenting). Should the audience for these too-much-repeated protestations be duly satisfied? We think not. The first problem with the majority’s account comes from JUSTICE

DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

In the 1973 case of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court held that a woman's right to have an abortion was protected by the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of liberty. In the 1992 case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Court reaffirmed this holding, explaining that a woman's right to choose whether or not to have an abortion is a fundamental right that must be protected from undue government intrusion. Today's decision in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius strikes down a key component of the Affordable Care Act, which required employers to provide health insurance that included coverage for contraception. In doing so, the Court significantly undermines the rights recognized in Roe and Casey. The majority opinion, written by Justice Alito, claims that this decision does not "cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion." However, the majority's reasoning is based on the premise that abortion is unique because it "terminates life or potential life." This reasoning is not only at odds with the Court's previous decisions, but it also ignores the fact that contraception also has the potential to terminate life. The dissent, written by Justice Ginsburg, argues that the majority's decision is "a radical departure from prior rulings" and "cannot be understood as anything other than an effort to gut Roe v. Wade." The dissent goes on to say that the majority's reasoning "is so full of holes that it cannot be taken seriously." In conclusion, the majority's decision in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius is a dangerous precedent that threatens to undermine the fundamental rights recognized in Roe and Casey.
