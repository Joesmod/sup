notion of reliance thus finds little support in our cases, which instead emphasize very concrete reliance interests, like those that develop in cases involving property and contract rights.

That form of reliance depends on an empirical question that is hard for anyoneand in particular, for a courtto assess, namely, the effect of the abortion right on society and in particular on the lives of women. The contending sides in this case make impassioned and conflicting arguments about the effects of the abortion right on the lives of women.

The contending sides also make conflicting arguments about the status of the fetus. This Court has neither the authority nor the expertise to adjudicate those disputes, and the Casey pluralitys speculations and weighing of the relative importance of the fetus and mother represent a departure from the original constitutional proposition that courts do not substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies. Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U. S. 726, 729730 (1963). Our decision returns the issue of abortion to those legislative bodies, and it allows women on both sides of the abortion issue to seek to affect the legislative process by influencing public opinion, lobbying legislators, voting, and running for office. Women are not without electoral or political power. It is noteworthy that the percentage of women who register to vote and cast ballots is consistently higher than the percentage of men who do so.66 In the last election in November 2020, women, who make up around 51.5 percent of the population of Mississippi,67 constituted  66See Dept. of Commerce, U.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court has ruled that the notion of reliance on Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood is not supported by previous cases, which instead focus on more concrete interests like property rights and contract law. The Court also found that it is difficult to assess the impact of abortion on society and women's lives, and that it is not the role of the judiciary to weigh the relative importance of the fetus and the mother.
