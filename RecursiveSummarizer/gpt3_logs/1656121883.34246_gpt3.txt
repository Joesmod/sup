Write a concise summary of the following:

U. S., at 844 (Marshall, J., dissenting). Roe has stood for fifty years. Casey, a precedent about precedent specifically confirming Roe, has stood for thirty. And the doctrine of stare decisisa critical element of the rule of lawstands foursquare behind their continued existence. The right those decisions established and preserved is embedded in our constitutional law, both originating in and leading to other rights protecting bodily integrity, personal autonomy, and family relationships. The abortion right is also embedded in the lives of women shaping their expectations, influencing their choices about relationships and work, supporting (as all reproductive rights do) their social and economic equality. Since the rights recognition (and affirmation), nothing has changed to support what the majority does today. Neither law nor facts nor attitudes have provided any new reasons to reach a different result than Roe and Casey did. All that has changed is this Court. Mississippiand other States tooknew exactly what they were doing in ginning up new legal challenges to Roe and Casey. The 15-week ban at issue here was enacted in 2018. Other States quickly followed: Between 2019 and 2021, eight States banned abortion procedures after six to  58 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting eight weeks of pregnancy, and three States enacted all-out bans.29 Mississippi itself decided in 2019 that it had not gone far enough: The year after enacting the law under review, the State passed a 6-week restriction. A state senator who championed both Mississippi laws said the obvious out loud. [A] lot of people thought, he explained, that finally, we have a conservative Court and so now would be a good time to start testing the limits of Roe.30 In its petition for certiorari, the State had exercised a smidgen of restraint. It had urged the Court merely to roll back Roe and Casey, specifically assuring the Court that the questions presented in this petition do not require the Court to overturn those precedents. Pet. for Cert. 5; see ante, at 56 (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment). But as Mississippi grew ever more confident in its prospects, it resolved to go all in. It urged the Court to overrule Roe and Casey. Nothing but everything would be enough. Earlier this Term, this Court signaled that Mississippis stratagem would succeed. Texas was one of the fistful of States to have recently banned abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. It added to that flagrantly unconstitutional restriction an unprecedented scheme to evade judicial  29Guttmacher Institute, E.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the right to abortion for 50 years, and this right is embedded in our constitutional law. However, states have been passing laws to restrict abortion, and this trend has accelerated in recent years. The Court signaled this year that it is likely to roll back Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that established the right to abortion. This would be a devastating blow to women's reproductive rights.
