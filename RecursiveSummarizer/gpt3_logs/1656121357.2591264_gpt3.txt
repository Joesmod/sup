JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court overruled in toto, and Roe itself was overruled in part.10 Casey threw out Roes trimester scheme and substituted a new rule of uncertain origin under which States were forbidden to adopt any regulation that imposed an undue burden on a womans right to have an abortion.11 The decision provided no clear guidance about the difference between a due and an undue burden. But the three Justices who authored the controlling opinion call[ed] the contending sides of a national controversy to end their national division by treating the Courts decision as the final settlement of the question of the constitutional right to abortion.12 As has become increasingly apparent in the intervening years, Casey did not achieve that goal. Americans continue to hold passionate and widely divergent views on abortion, and state legislatures have acted accordingly. Some have recently enacted laws allowing abortion, with few restrictions, at all stages of pregnancy. Others have tightly restricted abortion beginning well before viability. And in this case, 26 States have expressly asked this Court to overrule Roe and Casey and allow the States to regulate or prohibit pre-viability abortions. Before us now is one such state law. The State of Mississippi asks us to uphold the constitutionality of a law that generally prohibits an abortion after the 15th week of pregnancyseveral weeks before the point at which a fetus is now regarded as viable outside the womb. In defending this law, the States primary argument is that we should reconsider and overrule Roe and Casey and once again allow each State to regulate abortion as its citizens wish.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The question before the Court is whether to overturn Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood, which established a woman's right to have an abortion. The State of Mississippi has passed a law prohibiting abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The respondents and the Solicitor General argue that the Mississippi law cannot stand if Roe and Casey are not overturned. The Court will consider whether to overturn Roe and Casey and allow the State of Mississippi to prohibit abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.
