RESPONSE:

This section amends section 50(d) of the tax code to allow taxpayers to elect to exempt energy storage technology from the requirements of the section. The election must be made on the taxpayer's federal tax return for the year in which the technology is placed in service, and can only be revoked with the consent of the IRS. The exemption does not apply to energy storage technology with a maximum capacity of 500 kilowatt hours or less.
