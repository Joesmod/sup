Write a concise summary of the following:

The Supreme Court has ruled that the right to abortion is not a constitutional right, and that states can regulate abortion for legitimate reasons. This overturns the previous rulings in Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood, which had found such a right. The Court found that abortion is different from other issues because it involves the destruction of human life, and that precedent does not support the right to abortion. The Court also ruled that the doctrine of stare decisis does not require the continued acceptance of Roe and Casey, and that there are strong reasons to overturn those decisions.  The Supreme Court will hear a case on whether pre-viability prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional. The Mississippi Gestational Age Act is being challenged, which bans abortions after 15 weeks of gestation. Petitioners argue that the Act is constitutional because it satisfies rational-basis review. Respondents argue that allowing Mississippi to ban pre-viability abortions would be no different than overruling Casey and Roe v. Wade, which established a woman's right to have an abortion.  The Supreme Court has ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment does not protect the right to an abortion. This is because there is no support in American law for such a right. The English common law treated abortion as a crime, regardless of whether the fetus was quickened (i.e., when it first showed signs of life). This remained the case in America up until the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Supreme Court has ruled that there is no constitutional right to abortion, but that it is a unique act that destroys potential life. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has released a report on abortion surveillance in the United States for 2019, which concludes that the number of abortions has declined in recent years but that the rate of abortion has remained relatively stable.  The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that there is no constitutional right to abortion, and that the power to regulate abortion lies with the people and their elected representatives. The court overruled Roe v. Wade, finding that there is no support in history or precedent for the decision. The court also found that the state has a legitimate interest in protecting fetal life.  The U.S. Supreme Court should overrule the Roe and Casey decisions because they are in conflict with the Constitution and have had a disruptive effect on other areas of the law. Roe v. Wade removed the issue of abortion from the democratic process by finding a constitutional right to obtain an abortion, and the Court's reasoning in Roe has been heavily criticized. The Court should reconsider its decision in Roe in light of the overwhelming consensus of state laws in effect in 1868 that protected fetal life.  The U.S. Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision created a legal framework for abortion that has been widely criticized for its lack of a clear justification for the lines it drew between pre-
