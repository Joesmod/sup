This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California and the United States of America. The Agreement shall commence on the date of full execution and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of one (1) year, and shall automatically renew for successive one (1) year terms thereafter, unless either party provides the other party with written notice of its intention not to renew at least ninety (90) days prior to the expiration of the then-current term. The Company hereby retains the services of Contractor, and Contractor hereby agrees to provide the Services to the Company, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. The "Services" shall mean those professional services to be performed by Contractor for the Company as more particularly described on Exhibit A, which is attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.
