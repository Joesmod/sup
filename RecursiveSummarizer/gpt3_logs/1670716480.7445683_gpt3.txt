PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


us.  The projects are assigned to the contractors of the assigned zones wherein the project is located.  And those four zones are broken out into the Northeast, Northwest, Southeast, and Southwest regions of the city.  Each of those zones, the contracts are required to meet the 25% MBE requirement and 5% WBE requirement.  We also, we understand the importance of diversifying the contracts overall, but more importantly, in this case, we are looking to utilize and optimize the opportunity to encourage diversification of the subcontracting opportunities.  We have encouraged our contractors to reach far beyond their typical go-to subcontractors so that they're not just filling or meeting that 25 and 5%, that they're actually going beyond their typical norms to find subcontractors and companies of diverse backgrounds and essentially going into the communities where these projects are located and finding the businesses, the companies that can do the work that can actually be subcontractors for these projects.  And we have implemented and assisted with getting outreach programs in place in order to facilitate that.  And I also wanted to make mention that the 25% and 5% program goals, like Mr.  Whitaker also just explained, they are overall program goals, but we also strongly encourage our contractors to meet those goals for every single project individually.  And typically, I would say more often than not, our contractors do exceed by quite a bit, they do exceed the 25% and 5% participation requirements.  So at this time, that's all I have, but I am happy to answer any questions that you guys may have.  Thank you.  Audubon Lospada.  Hey, thank you, Chairman.  Robin, I'm just trying to understand because so I appreciate your participation in this program.  I'm also just noting that none of the primes that you work with are, MBE or WBE certified.  Is there a challenge that AIS finds in finding qualified minority or women-owned businesses to serve as clients? And if so, how


CONCISE SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

AIS encourages contractors to reach beyond their typical subcontractors to find businesses of diverse backgrounds for the city's 25% MBE and 5% WBE requirements.
