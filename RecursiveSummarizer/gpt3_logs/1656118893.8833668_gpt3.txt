DETAILED SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court has come under fire in recent years for its continued reliance on dubious scholarship when it comes to the issue of abortion. In particular, the Court has been criticized for its reliance on the work of Cyril Means, Jr., whose work on the history of abortion has been shown to be deeply flawed. Means' work is characterized by an internal memorandum as donning "the guise of impartial scholarship while advancing the proper ideological goals." This means that his work cannot be trusted as an accurate portrayal of history. The Solicitor General has suggested that history supports an abortion right because the common law's failure to criminalize abortion before quickening means that "at the Founding and for decades thereafter, women generally could terminate a pregnancy, at least in its early stages." However, the fact that many states in the 19th century did criminalize abortion, and that the common law was far from uniform on the issue, belies this claim. In addition, Roe v. Wade and subsequent cases have imposed significant restrictions on abortion after quickening, so the claim that women could generally terminate a pregnancy in its early stages is not accurate. Ultimately, the Supreme Court should not rely on Means' work or any other flawed scholarship when making decisions on such a sensitive and important issue.
