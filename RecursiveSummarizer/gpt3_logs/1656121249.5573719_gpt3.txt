This law, and the others that followed, were motivated by a desire to protect women's health and safety, as well as by a belief that abortion was morally wrong.

Since Roe was decided, there has been a continued effort to overturn it or restrict its scope. In 1992, the Court's decision in Planned Parenthood v.

The article discusses the history of abortion in the United States, starting with the common law. Under the common law, abortion was a crime at least after "quickening" (i.e., the first felt movement of the fetus in the womb, which usually occurs between the 16th and 18th week of pregnancy). American law followed the common law until a wave of statutory restrictions in the 1800s expanded criminal liability for abortions. By the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, three-quarters of the States had made abortion a crime at any stage of pregnancy, and the remaining States would soon follow. Roe v. Wade (1973) either ignored or misstated this history, and Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992) declined to reconsider Roe's faulty historical analysis. The English common law tradition held that abortion after quickening was a criminal act, punishable by law. This was based on the writings of legal scholars such as Blackstone, Coke, and Hale. In America, this common law tradition was adopted, and abortion was criminalized in many states by the mid-19th century. The reasons for this criminalization were twofold: to protect women's health and safety, and to uphold morality (as many believed that abortion was morally wrong). In 1973, the Supreme Court case of Roe v. Wade recognized a woman's right to abortion, basing this right on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Since Roe was decided, there has been a continued effort to overturn it or restrict its scope. In 1992, the Court's decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey reaffirmed the basic holding of Roe, but abandoned the strict scrutiny standard of review used in Roe, instead adopting a more permissive standard. This has allowed for a number of restrictions on abortion to be enacted in the years since. The question before the Court now is whether the right to abortion is fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty and deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition. To answer this question, the history of abortion must be examined. Abortion has been practiced throughout history, but it was not until the 19th century that it began to be regulated.
