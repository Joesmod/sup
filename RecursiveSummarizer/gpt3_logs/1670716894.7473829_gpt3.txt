PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


defense standpoint, the courts are absolutely crystal clear that you cannot run a quota or a set aside program that there has to be a mechanism to reduce goals or waive them based on good faith efforts so the fact that some people seem confused about that suggested to us that that some educational efforts there might be useful.  Many firms thought that there was insufficient monitoring of actual contractual compliance with M.W.B.E.  commitments.  This seemed to us to really be a resource issue that there aren't really necessarily enough people really to do this all the time and to take a look at the reports in the C2 contract compliance system to review those audits.  So beefed up resources there would be an advantage I think.  Same thing with full and complete contract data collection.  As part of the study we ended up having to go back to prime contractors to get data that were not in the city system because they hadn't been collected.  And we think that going forward that is important both to be able to produce reports in closer to real time, but also to support the next disparity study so that they don't it doesn't take so long and cost so much money.  And then we also suggested considering a new department to administer enhance the program.  This is very common amongst agencies across the country to have a separate unit that is devoted strictly to the M.W.B.E.  program, as opposed to having it quite so scattered amongst different departments and lines of reporting and responsibility.  Next slide please.  We thought that a construction working group would be useful.  Many of the people I interviewed said, this is really great.  We're happy you're here.  Thank you for listening to us.  We have a lot of things we want to tell you and we'd really like to do this more than once every five or six years.  And so we thought that some type of group that met regularly, certainly as any of these recommendations are considered or changes are going to be made to really work


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The study found that many firms were confused about the quota or set-aside program for M.W.B.E. (Minority and Women-Owned Businesses), and that there was insufficient monitoring of contractual compliance. It was suggested that educational efforts be made to improve understanding of the program, and that resources be beefed up to better monitor compliance. It was also suggested that a new department be created to administer the program, and that a construction working group be formed to meet regularly to discuss changes to the program.
