RESPONSE:

The amendments in this section apply to hydrogen produced after December 31, 2022, and to electricity produced after that date if it is used to produce clean hydrogen. The credit for electricity production from renewable resources is allowed if the electricity is used to produce clean hydrogen. Clean hydrogen production facilities may be treated as energy property.
