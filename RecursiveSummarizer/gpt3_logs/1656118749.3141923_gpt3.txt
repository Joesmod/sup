DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

In the early 1990s, the Supreme Court of the United States was divided on the issue of abortion. The Court had previously ruled in Roe v. Wade that abortion was a constitutional right, but some justices wanted to overturn that decision. In 1992, the Court considered a case called Planned Parenthood v. Casey. The Court majority in Casey threw out Roe’s trimester scheme and replaced it with a new rule under which states could not adopt any regulation that imposed an “undue burden” on a woman’s right to have an abortion. The decision provided no clear guidance about the difference between a “due” and an “undue” burden. The three justices who authored the controlling opinion in Casey said that the Court’s decision was the final settlement of the question of the constitutional right to abortion. However, in the years since Casey was decided, it has become increasingly apparent that the decision did not settle the issue of abortion. Americans continue to hold passionate and widely divergent views on abortion, and state legislatures have passed laws accordingly. Some states have recently enacted laws allowing abortion with few restrictions at all stages of pregnancy, while other states have tightly restricted abortion beginning well before viability. In this case, the state of Mississippi is asking the Supreme Court to uphold a law that generally prohibits abortion after the 15th week of pregnancy. In defending this law, the state’s primary argument is that the Court should reconsider and overturn Roe and Casey, and allow each state to regulate abortion as its citizens wish. Respondents and the Solicitor General, on the other hand, argue that the Court should reaffirm Roe and Casey and strike down the Mississippi law. They contend that allowing Mississippi to prohibit abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy would be the same as overruling Roe and Casey entirely.
