In Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court held that a woman's right to have an abortion was protected by the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of liberty. In the 1992 case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Court reaffirmed this holding, explaining that a woman's right to choose whether or not to have an abortion is a private choice that falls within this right to control one's own body. The majority in the current case does not say whether a state may prevent a woman from obtaining an abortion when she and her doctor have determined it is a needed medical treatment.
