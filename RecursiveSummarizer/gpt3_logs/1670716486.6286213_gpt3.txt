Write a concise summary of the following:


as it relates to the solicitation requirements.  And lowest bid is one of the primary requirements.  Yeah, and I do think that the language says lowest responsible bidder.  And I think we should perhaps look at what we as a city mean by responsible.  And I would hope that part of that is equity, especially around city owned or city resource projects or companies that receive resources from the city should be held to a different standard, especially when it comes to equity because the resources are coming from such a diverse equity pool, meaning our taxes and whatnot.  And it should kind of go back out to the community in that way.  So I think, Chairman, I would like to look at that, how we kind of define responsible.  Because the lowest bidder is not necessarily the best for the city because the lowest bidder may not even be domiciled and the city may not have a lot of city employees, may not disperse contracts equitably.  And so I would say that a responsible bidder may not be the lowest bidder, but they may impact the city and save us more money.  And I think that's what the intention is with the lowest bidder, right? It's saving us money.  And so I think we should take a better, a different approach to saving us money and what that means.  So that's a good point.  Maybe if our CPO of Velescres, could you give us just a quick overview of the difference between a responsible bidder and a responsive bidder? And the second question is, were any of these contracts for the JOC given preference points or credits or the like based on other incentives in the bids that we use generally for contracts in general? So if you could respond to those two things, I would appreciate it.  Yeah, when it comes to, I believe the language is responsive and we will go back and double check on that, Alderman King.  But when we talk about responsive, it alludes to the requirements when we submitted the bid for the vendors to consider responding to it.  What were the requirements that we


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The city should consider a vendor's ability to meet the requirements of the project when evaluating bids, rather than simply selecting the lowest bidder. This will ensure that the city gets the best value for its money. Additionally, the city should evaluate whether any of the bids for the JOC contract include preferences or credits that could save the city money.
