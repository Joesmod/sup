was workability. See 505 U. S., at 870. But see ante, at 53 (opinion of the Court) (discussing the difficulties in applying the viability standard). Although the plurality attempted to add more content by opining that it might be said that a woman who fails to act before viability has consented to the States intervention on behalf of the developing child, Casey, 505 U. S., at 870, that mere suggestion provides no basis for choosing viability as the critical tipping point. A similar implied consent argument could be made with respect to a law banning abortions after fifteen weeks, well beyond the point at which nearly all women are aware that they are pregnant, A. Ayoola, M. Nettleman, M. Stommel, & R. Canady, Time    4 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment of Pregnancy Recognition and Prenatal Care Use: A Population-based Study in the United States 39 (2010) (Pregnancy Recognition). The dissent, which would retain the viability line, offers no justification for it either. This Courts jurisprudence since Casey, moreover, has eroded the underpinnings of the viability line, such as they were. United States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 521 (1995). The viability line is a relic of a time when we recognized only two state interests warranting regulation of abortion: maternal health and protection of potential life. Roe, 410 U. S., at 162163. That changed with Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U. S. 124 (2007). There, we recognized a broader array of interests, such as drawing a bright line that clearly distinguishes abortion and infanticide, maintaining societal ethics, and preserving the integrity of the medical profession. Id., at 157160. The viability line has nothing to do with advancing such permissible goals. Cf. id., at 171 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (Gonzales blur[red] the line, firmly drawn in Casey, between previability and postviability abortions); see also R. Beck, Gonzales, Casey, and the Viability Rule, 103 Nw. U. L. Rev. 249, 276279 (2009). Consider, for example, statutes passed in a number of jurisdictions that forbid abortions after twenty weeks of pregnancy, premised on the theory that a fetus can feel pain at that stage of development. See, e.g., Ala. Code 2623B2 (2018). Assuming that prevention of fetal pain is a legitimate state interest after Gonzales, there seems to be no reason why viability would be relevant to the permissibility of such laws. The same is true of laws designed to protect[] the integrity and ethics of the medical profession and restrict procedures likely to coarsen society to the dignity of human life. Gonzales, 550 U. S., at 157. Mississippis law, for instance, was premised in part on the legislatures finding that the dilation and evacuation procedure is a barbaric practice, dangerous for the maternal patient, and    Cite as: 597 U.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The United States Supreme Court has ruled that a state may not ban abortions after fifteen weeks of pregnancy, as this violates a woman's constitutional right to privacy. The Court has also ruled that the viability line is a relic of a time when the only two state interests warranting regulation of abortion were maternal health and protection of potential life.
