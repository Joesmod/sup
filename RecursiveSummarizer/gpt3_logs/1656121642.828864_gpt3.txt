But, in future cases, we should follow the text of the Constitution, which sets forth certain substantive rights that cannot be taken away, and adds, beyond that, a right to due process when life, liberty, or property is to be taken away.

I write separately to explain my additional views about why Roe was wrongly decided, why Roe should be overruled at this time, and the future implications of todays decision. I Abortion is a profoundly difficult and contentious issue because it presents an irreconcilable conflict between the interests of a pregnant woman who seeks an abortion and the interests in protecting fetal life. The interests on both sides of the abortion issue are extraordinarily weighty. On the one side, many pro-choice advocates forcefully argue that the ability to obtain an abortion is critically important for womens personal and professional lives, and for womens health. They contend that the widespread availability of abortion has been essential for women to advance in society and to achieve greater equality over the last 50 years. And they maintain that women must have the freedom to choose for themselves whether to have an abortion. On the other side, many pro-life advocates forcefully argue that a fetus is a human life. They contend that all human life should be protected as a matter of human dignity

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Court overrules Roe and Casey, two previous decisions that found a constitutional right to abortion. The harm caused by these decisions is immeasurable, according to Thomas. He argues that the Court should follow the text of the Constitution in future cases, which sets forth certain substantive rights that cannot be taken away. Kavanaugh concurs, writing separately to explain his view that Roe was wrongly decided and should be overruled.
