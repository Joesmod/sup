Write a concise summary of the following:


interest in seeing successful models of modular housing, both for the potential, as you move to scale to bring down costs and just to be able to build housing more effectively.  I was just curious.  This might be actually DPD or housing question.  The underlying zoning is RT dash for right it did I see that correctly.  Yes, you did.  Is there.  And this is kind of a thought that's been percolating for a while but is there a reason why we're doing single family homes rather than looking at two or three flats, given what the zoning would permit.  I think in this instance, there is, he doesn't have a two flat model ready yet.  So we've been working with him for probably 18 months I'm getting this going.  These are going to be resolved to RS three by the way, I did mention that I believe.  I was just curious because I know we even for myself 340,000 is more than my wife and I could have afforded for home five years ago and if we, if we can think particularly with you all about a modular two flat model that added income really is beneficial for folks being able to afford homes, particularly at this price point so hopefully that conversation and maybe more broadly with Department of Housing we think about how to encourage to plant development in the city conversation for another day though I appreciate the work that you're doing.

Yes, thank you Mr Chairman, I just wanted to ask Brian O'Donnell if he could do the chair, because I think there's this project in the 27th Ward and another another initiative in North Wanda and I, which I also believe is modular.  And I think it's by a different.  By kinics.  Right.  So can you put together this through the chair, a comparison sheet that tells me like the square footage number of bathrooms number of bedrooms pricing materials, because I, as I mentioned to you I'm still looking for an opportunity to build this kind of housing in my ward and I just want to see, you know, who's got
