Because the Court has “vindicated [the] principle” over and over that (no matter the sentiment in 1868) “there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enter”—especially relating to “bodily integrity” and “family life.” Id., at 847, 849, 851. Casey described in detail the Court’s contraception cases. See id., at 848–849, 851–853. It noted decisions protecting the right to marry, including to someone of another race. See id., at 847–848 (“[I]nterracial marriage was illegal in most States in the 19th century, but the Court was no doubt correct in finding it to be an aspect of liberty protected against state interference”). In reviewing decades and decades of constitutional law, Casey could draw but one conclusion: Whatever was true in 1868, “[i]t is settled now, as it was when the Court heard arguments in Roe v. Wade, that the Constitution places limits on a State’s right to interfere with a person’s most basic decisions about family and parenthood.” Id., at 849. And that conclusion still held good, until the Court’s intervention here. It was settled at the time of Roe, settled at the time of Casey, and settled yesterday that the Constitution places limits on a State’s power to assert control over an individual’s body and most personal decisionmaking. A multitude of decisions supporting that principle led to Roe’s recognition and Casey’s reaffirmation of the right to choose; and Roe and Casey in turn supported additional protections for intimate and familial relations.

And indeed, it has given no other reason for overruling Roe and Casey. Ante, at 15–16. We are not mindreaders, but here is our best guess as to what the majority means. It says next that “[a]bortion is nothing new.” Ante, at 33. So apparently, the Fourteenth Amendment might provide protection for things wholly unknown in the 19th century; maybe one day there could be constitutional protection for, oh, time travel. But as to anything that was known back then (such as abortion or contraception), no such luck.   20 DOBBS v.

DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The majority opinion in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization case held that the "specific practice" of abortion is not protected by the Fourteenth Amendment's substantive sphere of liberty. In doing so, the majority overruled the precedent set by Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood. The majority's opinion is based on the premise that the Fourteenth Amendment was not intended to protect abortion when it was ratified in 1868. The majority argues that because abortion was not a "specific practice" protected by the Amendment at the time, it cannot be protected now. The dissent argues that this interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment is contrary to decades of precedent protecting a woman's right to choose. The dissent also points out that the majority's opinion will have far-reaching implications beyond the abortion context, potentially jeopardizing other areas of constitutional law that protect personal liberty.
