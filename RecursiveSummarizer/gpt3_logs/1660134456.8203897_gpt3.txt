RESPONSE:

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act amends the tax code to provide a credit for corporations that have paid or accrued income, war profits, and excess profits taxes to any foreign country or possession of the United States. The credit is available for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and before January 1, 2026. The credit is equal to the lesser of the amount of taxes paid or accrued, or the product of the amount of the adjustment under section 56A(c)(3) and the percentage specified in section 55(b)(2)(A)(i). The credit is carryoverable for five succeeding taxable years.
