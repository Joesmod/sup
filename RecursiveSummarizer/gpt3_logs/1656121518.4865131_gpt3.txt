CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Court's abortion cases have been problematic, to say the least. They have led to the distortion of many important but unrelated legal doctrines, and that effect provides further support for overruling those decisions. Members of this Court have repeatedly lamented that no legal rule or doctrine is safe from ad hoc nullification by this Court when an occasion for its application arises in a case involving state regulation of abortion. The continued adherence to the current standard would undermine, not advance, the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles.
