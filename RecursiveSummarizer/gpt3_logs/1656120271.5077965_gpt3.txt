Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms, as affirmed in the case of McDonald v. Chicago. In order to determine whether this right is fundamental, the Supreme Court looks to historical evidence such as the debates in Congress at the time of the Amendment's ratification, state constitutions in effect at that time, and federal laws enacted during the same period. The Court has found that the right to keep and bear arms is deeply rooted in our history and tradition and is essential to our system of ordered liberty.  In this case, the Supreme Court is being asked to recognize a constitutional right to abortion. The Court has been cautioned in the past about being too quick to recognize new rights that are not specifically mentioned in the Constitution. The Court has also been warned about the dangers of engaging in "freewheeling judicial policymaking" when it comes to issues of liberty. The Court must carefully consider what the Fourteenth Amendment means by the term "liberty." After looking at the history and tradition of the concept of ordered liberty in America, the Court has concluded that the Fourteenth Amendment does not protect the right to an abortion.

The article discusses the history of abortion in the United States, starting with the common law. Under the common law, abortion was a crime at least after "quickening" (i.e., the first felt movement of the fetus in the womb, which usually occurs between the 16th and 18th week of pregnancy). American law followed the common law until a wave of statutory restrictions in the 1800s expanded criminal liability for abortions. By the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, three-quarters of the States had made abortion a crime at any stage of pregnancy, and the remaining States would soon follow. Roe v.
