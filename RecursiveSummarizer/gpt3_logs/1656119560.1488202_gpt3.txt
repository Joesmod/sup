Write a detailed summary of the following:

contraception and marriage—in particular, the decisions in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965); Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438 (1972); Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967); and Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U. S. 644 (2015). I emphasize what the Court today states: Overruling Roe does not mean the overruling of those precedents, and does not threaten or cast doubt on those precedents. Second, as I see it, some of the other abortion-related legal questions raised by today’s decision are not especially difficult as a constitutional matter. For example, may a State bar a resident of that State from traveling to another State to obtain an abortion? In my view, the answer is no based on the constitutional right to interstate travel. May a State retroactively impose liability or punishment for an abortion that occurred before today’s decision takes effect? In my view, the answer is no based on the Due Process Clause or the Ex Post Facto Clause. Cf. Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U. S. 347 (1964). Other abortion-related legal questions may emerge in the  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 11 KAVANAUGH, J., concurring future. But this Court will no longer decide the fundamental question of whether abortion must be allowed throughout the United States through 6 weeks, or 12 weeks, or 15 weeks, or 24 weeks, or some other line. The Court will no longer decide how to evaluate the interests of the pregnant woman and the interests in protecting fetal life throughout pregnancy. Instead, those difficult moral and policy questions will be decided, as the Constitution dictates, by the people and their elected representatives through the constitutional processes of democratic self-government. * * * The Roe Court took sides on a consequential moral and policy issue that this Court had no constitutional authority to decide. By taking sides, the Roe Court distorted the Nation’s understanding of this Court’s proper role in the American constitutional system and thereby damaged the Court as an institution. As Justice Scalia explained, Roe “destroyed the compromises of the past, rendered compromise impossible for the future, and required the entire issue to be resolved uniformly, at the national level.” Casey, 505 U. S., at 995 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). The Court’s decision today properly returns the Court to a position of judicial neutrality on the issue of abortion, and properly restores the people’s authority to resolve the issue of abortion through the processes of democratic selfgovernment established by the Constitution. To be sure, many Americans will disagree with the Court’s decision today. That would be true no matter how the Court decided this case. Both sides on the abortion issue believe sincerely and passionately in the rightness of their cause. Especially in those difficult and fraught circumstances, the Court must scrupulously adhere to the Constitution’s neutral position on the issue of abortion. Since 1973,

DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court has issued several landmark decisions regarding contraception and marriage, including Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), Eisenstadt v. Baird (1972), Loving v. Virginia (1967), and Obergefell v. Hodges (2015). In each of these cases, the Court has affirmed the constitutional right to privacy, which encompasses the right to make decisions about one's own body and reproductive health. Today, the Court issued a decision in a case that challenges Roe v. Wade (1973), the landmark case that legalized abortion nationwide. In the Roe decision, the Court had taken sides on a moral and policy issue that it lacked the constitutional authority to decide. By doing so, the Court damaged its own reputation and legitimacy. Today's decision returns the Court to a position of neutrality on the issue of abortion, and restores the people's authority to resolve the issue through the democratic process. Many Americans will disagree with the Court's decision, but it is important that the Court adhere to the Constitution's neutral stance on this divisive issue.
