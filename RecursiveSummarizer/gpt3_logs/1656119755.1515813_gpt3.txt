DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

In 1868, the U.S. Supreme Court would not have recognized a woman's claim to reproductive rights - because they would not have seen the person making it as a full-fledged member of the community. Throughout our history, the sphere of protected liberty has expanded, bringing in individuals formerly excluded. In that way, the constitutional values of liberty and equality go hand in hand; they do not inhabit the hermetically sealed containers the majority portrays. The Court expanded in successive cases those who could claim the right to marry - though their relationships would have been outside the law's protection in the mid-19th century. And after Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Court continued in that vein, with a critical stop to hold that the Fourteenth Amendment protected same-sex intimacy, and then resolving that the Amendment also conferred on same-sex couples the right to marry. In considering that question, the Court held that "history and tradition" guide and discipline the inquiry. But the sentiments of 1868 alone do not and cannot "rule the present." Casey similarly recognized the need to extend the constitutional sphere of liberty to a previously excluded group - women. The Court then understood that the men who ratified the Fourteenth Amendment and wrote the state laws of the time did not view women as full and equal citizens. A woman then, Casey wrote, "had no legal existence separate from her husband." Women were seen only "as the center of home and family life," without "full and independent legal status under the Constitution." But that could not be true any longer: The State could not now insist on the historically dominant "vision of the woman's role." And equal citizenship, Casey realized, was inescapably connected to reproductive rights. "The ability of women to participate equally" in the "life of the Nation" - in all its economic, social, political, and legal aspects - "has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives." Without the ability to decide whether and when to have children, women could not - in the way men took for granted - determine how they would live their lives, and how they would contribute to the society around them.
