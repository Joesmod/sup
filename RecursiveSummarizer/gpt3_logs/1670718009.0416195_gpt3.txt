PROMPT:

Write an explanation as to how the following will benefit the City:


awaited project has now been renamed for a pioneering black activist and labor organizer in Chicago.  Another update is the Montclair Joanne Thompson Senior Residences.  Mayor Lightfoot joined Alderman Coleman of the 16th ward and other officials for the April 13th grand opening of the $26 million senior building in Inglewood.  Montclair Joanne Thompson Senior Residences of Inglewood at 63rd and Green was approved by city council in April of 2017.  The 102-unit development was named in honor of the late 16th ward, Alderman Joanne Thompson who died in 2015.  And lastly on our multi-family initiatives is rental assistance.  That was a new line of work for us for the last couple years.  On May 2nd, the Department of Housing marked the conclusion of the fourth round of direct emergency rental assistance to renters and landlords financially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.  The final totals, $170 million in direct rent and utility payments that helped more than 30,000 families stay in their homes.  E-wrap too included $102 million from the American rescue plan act of 2021 and provided up to 18 months of rental assistance and utility payment assistance for impacted renters.  Both rounds of E-wrap prioritized households earning less than 50% ami which is approximately 46,600 for a family of four.  DOH opened applications for E-wrap last December as the department completed the distribution of $80 million already received on their federal legislation passed in December 2020.  U.S.  Treasury guidelines required 65% of these funds to be obligated by September 30th, 2021.  The city of Chicago finally met that deadline.  And although new applications are no longer being accepted under E-wrap too, DOH now provides court-based E-wrap or C-E-wrap for the county eviction court system through early resolution program offered by the county legal aid for housing and debt.  I'll talk a little bit about that later with right to council.  Moving over to home ownership support.  DOH
