Write a detailed summary of the following:

prenatal life,” “protection of maternal health,” elimination of certain “medical procedures,” “mitigation of fetal pain,” and others. Ante, at 78. This Court will surely face critical questions about how that test applies. Must a state law allow abortions when necessary to protect a woman’s life and health? And if so, exactly when? How much risk to a woman’s life can a State force —————— pressive. The majority says that lower courts have split over how to apply the undue burden standard to parental notification laws. See ante, at 60, and n. 54. But that is not so. The state law upheld had an exemption for minors demonstrating adequate maturity, whereas the ones struck down did not. Compare Planned Parenthood of Blue Ridge v. Camblos, 155 F. 3d 352, 383–384 (CA4 1998), with Planned Parenthood of Ind. & Ky., Inc. v. Adams, 937 F. 3d 973, 981 (CA7 2019), cert. granted, judgment vacated, 591 U. S. ___ (2020), and Planned Parenthood, Sioux Falls Clinic v. Miller, 63 F. 3d 1452, 1460 (CA8 1995). The majority says there is a split about bans on certain types of abortion procedures. See ante, at 61, and n. 55. But the one court to have separated itself on that issue did so based on a set of factual findings significantly different from those in other cases. Compare Whole Woman’s Health v. Paxton, 10 F. 4th 430, 447–453 (CA5 2021), with EMW Women’s Surgical Center, P.S.C. v. Friedlander, 960 F. 3d 785, 798–806 (CA6 2020), and West Ala. Women’s Center v. Williamson, 900 F. 3d 1310, 1322–1324 (CA11 2018). Finally, the majority says there is a split about whether an increase in travel time to reach a clinic is an undue burden. See ante, at 61, and n. 56. But the cases to which the majority refers predate this Court’s decision in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, 579 U. S. 582 (2016), which clarified how to apply the undue burden standard to that context.  36 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting her to incur, before the Fourteenth Amendment’s protection of life kicks in? Suppose a patient with pulmonary hypertension has a 30-to-50 percent risk of dying with ongoing pregnancy; is that enough? And short of death, how much illness or injury can the State require her to accept, consistent with the Amendment’s protection of liberty and equality? Further, the Court may face questions about the application of abortion regulations to medical care most people view as quite different from abortion. What about the morning-after pill? IUDs? In vitro fertilization? And how about the use of dilation and evacuation or medication for miscarriage management? See generally L. Harris, Navigating Loss of Abortion Services—A Large Academic Medical Center Prepares for the Overturn of Roe v. Wade, 386 New England J. Med. 2061 (2022).12 Finally, the majority’s ruling today invites a host of questions about interstate conflicts. See supra, at 3; see generally D. Cohen, G. Donley, & R.

DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court has ruled that states can regulate abortion as long as they don't place an "undue burden" on women seeking the procedure. This ruling will have a significant impact on how states regulate abortion going forward. The majority opinion was written by Justice Clarence Thomas, and was joined by Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh. The dissent was written by Justice Stephen Breyer, and was joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. The majority opinion upholds a Mississippi law that requires abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital. The Court also upheld a requirement that abortion providers must give women seeking an abortion at least 24 hours to consider the decision, as well as a ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The dissent argued that the Mississippi law placed an undue burden on women seeking an abortion, and that the 24-hour waiting period was unnecessary and would only serve to delay care. The dissent also argued that the 15-week abortion ban was too restrictive and would prevent many women from accessing safe and legal abortion care.
