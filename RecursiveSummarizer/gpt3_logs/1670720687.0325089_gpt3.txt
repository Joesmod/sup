PROMPT:

Write out the proposed spending as a dollar amount and what the spending is for of the following:


pro bono study.  How in a $16 billion budget we cannot have a fully funded for both of them.  So I will talk about the, the justice project that we do have funding to start with the planning, that is not to say that once the planning is completed when we have a better idea of what the broader cost is that that is part of that conversation.  I think that's the first step and there is funding for for that piece of it, so that we get an idea of what the full cost is, and then we can have that conversation.  In terms of the study.  You know, I will ask Angela maybe to chime in but you know I think what I will say is that I think there's a lot of interest in in, you know, us, and what this robust Department of Environment will look like and so you know, I think that's where we are starting with that pro bono assistance.  And then can you please repeat your question.  So my question is in a $16 billion budget, right and I think I'm good to see at least some movement on funding positions for to address or regulate against the environmental and justices that we see, but in a $16 billion budget, we are relying on a pro bono study, I'm not clear with that.  Because as you know, for us the community of impact study is going to be critical as we review future permits, and again, we will not allow more polluters to come in and dump all sorts of toxics in our community without proper regulation so these communities impact study cannot be put in the hands of a pro bono study.  So, the pro bono scope for the study is tied to the best governance structure for the office plus the Department of Environment so what we are evaluating in that study is the feasibility looking at gaps and services, which I know that people have very strong opinions on what the Department of Environment, plus the Climate Office should do.  It's looking at sustainable revenue sources as you all know if you were here from before.  A lot of the work of the former Department of Environment was grant funded, and


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The proposed spending is for a pro bono study to determine the best governance structure for the new Department of Environment, plus the Climate Office. The study will also look at gaps and services and sustainable revenue sources.
