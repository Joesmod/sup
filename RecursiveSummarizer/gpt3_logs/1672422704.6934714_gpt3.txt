forward to your confirmation.  Thank you.  Yes.  Thank you, Alderman.  And yes, AIS is taking the lead on this issue.  We'll be working with a brokerage firm to help us identify a portfolio of facilities that can work for, you know, different populations needs.  So we are starting that work.  Thank you.  Thank you, Alderman Osterman.  Alderman Curtis has joined us and will be counted towards Quorum.  Alderman Villegas.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  And thank you Acting Commissioner Blake Moore.  You know, AIS is a very important department, not just for the facility side, but more interested on the technology side, because there's a huge opportunity for Chicago to distinguish itself as a leader in technology within the public sector.  And I think that over the last few years, we've been missing that opportunity.  So I'm glad to hear that in talking to you yesterday, but what your vision is.  And the Gartner report that was done really laid out a pathway for us to succeed as a city in finding efficiencies, finding savings.  And that's been the reason why the Economic Capital Technology Committee has been very aggressive, because we can't continue to go back to taxpayers every time we're short.  We've got to find ways to utilize technology to deliver services.  I often say that the city of Chicago, we don't manufacture or sell widgets, we sell a service.  And technology is going to be an opportunity for us to deliver those services in an efficient manner.  So I'm looking forward to working with you.  I'm very excited about your appointment and what it is that you have and what you envision as we move forward with the city investing in technology.  So there'll be hundreds of millions of dollars that are thrown at AIS in order to modify the IT.  But we got to be strategic, because those dollars don't come around very often.  So looking forward to working with you to implement the technology upgrades.  And very excited about your appointment.  So looking forward to working
