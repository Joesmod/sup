disadvantaged areas.  That's correct.  Yes, as far as the project area definition, I'm going to ask Commissioner Valesquez to give us that answer.  And I'm going to turn it over to Radia to respond to that definition.  Yes, Alderman King, in the current, Alderman King, in the current language or in the proposed ordinance, there is a definition for the term project area resident.  And that term is defined as persons domiciled within that part of the city designated the project area.  I'm sorry.  Defined as what? It's defined as persons domiciled in that part of the city designated as the project area in the information for bidders issued by DPS.  So, what I understand from this definition is that whenever a bid is out, DPS defines in the bid document is what it considers to be project area for each bid.  So, that's how the project area and the residents of the project area are defined under current ordinance.  You said Department of Planning defines what the project area is? Yes, according to the language we have currently now.  So, there's not an objective view, it's defined every time? Actually, sorry, Alderman King says, it's defined by information for bidders issued by DPS, Department of Procurement Services, not DPD.  Yeah, I got that piece, but maybe I'm not hearing, is it not a defined area, like half mile radius from the project or what? I believe operationally they may have metrics.  I mean, DPS, I defer to DPS as to how they prepare that information to bidders, but my understanding is that.  Yeah, well, no.  Not to belabor it chairman, but maybe that's a way to get to people around the project, getting first dibs who are also from the socioeconomically disadvantaged or who are also defined in that category people in the project area would get first dibs so that you can kind of get to local folks taking advantage of this opportunity.  And then do we have a sense of, it seems like this wasn't working before, do we have a sense of what type of hiring occurred


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The proposed ordinance defines "project area resident" as a person who lives in the part of the city designated as the project area in the information for bidders issued by the Department of Procurement Services. This allows for a more objective view of who is considered a project area resident, rather than relying on the Department of Planning's definition.
