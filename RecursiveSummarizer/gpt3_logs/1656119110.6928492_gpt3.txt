DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that unconstitutional restrictions on abortion have proved to be impossible to draw with precision. The Court has also ruled that the balancing test from Whole Woman's Health correctly states the undue-burden framework. However, the Court has also ruled that parental notification rules are constitutional, and that bans on certain dilation and evacuation procedures are constitutional. The Court has also ruled that when an increase in the time needed to reach a clinic constitutes an undue burden, and that a State may regulate abortions performed because of the fetus's race, sex, or disability.
