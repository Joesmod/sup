Write a concise summary of the following:


like they're paying market rate value.  Secondly, my question is, do you as a department give consideration for any kind of credits like for cleaning the site, maintaining the site cutting the grass things that the city of Chicago would have been responsible for over the years to bet.  Is that taken into consideration when you come up with these sale prices I support this land sale.  I just think the amount of money is.  And I know you say the church agreed to it but I think they're deserving of given what we heard in the last one they're deserving of some break credits for maintenance at least.  Okay.  Yeah, again right.  The last size is 25 feet wide, 125 feet deep.  The I do need to kind of step back and say that the movie use the word negotiated sale and market rate sale they're really for us functionally they're equivalent the, the, the purchases at market rate value.  And I think we kind of need to kind of emphasize that the sale is to a church churches as policy, the city as we are we're not able to provide discounts from the land sale or lady land right down to a church or a religious organization.  The reason we do that is we cannot.  We're not allowed not allowed to favor one church over another which would be a violation of the First Amendment, because that reason all city land sales to churches need to say at market value.  And I'm asking you to favor them over any other church, I'm asking the question about whether or not the department considers credits that you know to reduce the price for property that is not city that is not privately owned I mean it's city own and this church you know maintain the property cut the grass cleaned up the garbage that's tossed from wherever is that taken into consideration, either here, or in other church sales across the city.  Alderman know what we we do not take into consideration so that we don't have ability right now to credit a, a, a buyer in this situation for prior, prior maintenance costs social debt so
