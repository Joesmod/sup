Write a concise summary of the following:

v. United States, 530 U. S. 428, 443 (2000). Casey itself applied those principles, in one of this Courts most important precedents about precedent. After assessing the traditional stare decisis factors, Casey reached the only conclusion possible that stare decisis operates powerfully here. It still does. The standards Roe and Casey set out are perfectly workable. No changes in either law or fact have eroded the two decisions. And tens of millions of American women have relied, and continue to rely, on the right to choose. So under traditional stare decisis principles, the majority has no special justification for the harm it causes. And indeed, the majority comes close to conceding that point. The majority barely mentions any legal or factual changes that have occurred since Roe and Casey. It suggests that the two decisions are hard for courts to implement, but cannot prove its case. In the end, the majority says, all it must say to override stare decisis is one thing: that it believes Roe and Casey egregiously wrong. Ante, at 70. That rule could equally spell the end of any precedent with which a bare majority of the present Court disagrees.   Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 33 BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting So how does that approach prevent the scale of justice from waver[ing] with every new judges opinion? 1 Blackstone 69. It does not. It makes radical change too easy and too fast, based on nothing more than the new views of new judges. The majority has overruled Roe and Casey for one and only one reason: because it has always despised them, and now it has the votes to discard them. The majority thereby substitutes a rule by judges for the rule of law. A Contrary to the majoritys view, there is nothing unworkable about Caseys undue burden standard. Its primary focus on whether a State has placed a substantial obstacle on a woman seeking an abortion is the sort of inquiry familiar to judges across a variety of contexts. June Medical Services L. L. C. v. Russo, 591 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 6) (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment). And it has given rise to no more conflict in application than many standards this Court and others unhesitatingly apply every day. General standards, like the undue burden standard, are ubiquitous in the law, and particularly in constitutional adjudication. When called on to give effect to the Constitutions broad principles, this Court often crafts flexible standards that can be applied case-by-case to a myriad of unforeseeable circumstances. See Dickerson, 530 U. S., at 441 (No court laying down a general rule can possibly foresee the various circumstances in which it must apply). So, for example, the Court asks about undue or substantial burdens on speech, on voting, and on interstate commerce. See, e.g., Arizona Free Enterprise Clubs Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett, 564 U. S. 721, 748 (2011); Burdick v. Takushi, 504 U. S. 428, 433434 (1992); Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.,

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court has overruled Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood, two landmark decisions that guaranteed a woman's right to an abortion. The Court's decision is based on the principle of stare decisis, which dictates that precedent should be followed unless there is a compelling reason to do otherwise. The majority opinion argues that Roe and Casey are no longer workable because they have been eroded by changes in law and fact. However, the dissent argues that the standards set forth in Roe and Casey are perfectly workable and that there is no justification for overruling them.
