In addition to four more positions for homeless outreach, which is again critical that's on the ground, people out in communities across the city.  I recommend you know my colleague, what other woman had is not here but I know she worked on it with a lot of other alderman to make sure that that was done.  So I appreciate you listening to us on that.  I also appreciate in the new Commission on public safety police accountability.  There's a community liaison position which will be helpful in bridging that divide.  I'm here in working with the Commission with the police and communities.  I do have to say, just on the Department of Environment.  I'm curious as to who's against this right because the black caucus supports it.  The progressive caucus supports it.  The Latino caucus supports it.  Others of us who are not in a caucus but are allied with all of those caucuses support this.  Is there like some group in the city or some entity that's out there that is like trying to prevent a Department of Environment because it just, I'm kind of scratching my head, trying to see why we don't do this.  And I've heard all the reasons but I'm just, is there some other reason that I'm not aware of.  So, to answer your question, you know, I'm not aware of anyone that's blocking or the obstacle I think you know where the discussion is is like, like, what does a full blown department look like.  Like I said I think you know we have some work to do that it wasn't, it's not about just, you know, pulling different pieces from all the departments, but that you know this is an office starting with 10 people, I think we recognize that you know it's, it's the policy.  It's you know the Commission all the work that's going to happen in the next year that we want to get to a full blown department that I think you know all of us here have that want that and have that intention and want to get to.  So I think that's where we're trying to get to the management ordinance what you see before you
