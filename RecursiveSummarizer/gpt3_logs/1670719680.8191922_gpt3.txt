Write a summary of the following conversation:


OLSON: Well -- JUSTICE BARRETT: Can the gay rights organization do that? MR. OLSON: Right. I think there that's very unlikely to be a public accommodation, so the answer is likely yes, but JUSTICE BARRETT: Well, they're paid. Why? I mean, they're paid. I mean, they -- they craft these for -- it's a business, it's a commercial enterprise, but they craft these announcements for the gay community. MR. OLSON: I guess -- who crafts the announcements? I thought it was -- JUSTICE BARRETT: So it's a -- it's a -- it's a -- it's a gay rights enterprise.

RESPONSE:

Mr. Olson argues that if the organization is considered a public accommodation, then they would not be able to discriminate against any protected characteristic, including opposite-sex marriage announcements.
