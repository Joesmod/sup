Write a concise summary of the following:


administration of the program.  All right, thank you much.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  Thank you.  Thank you so much, Audemars.  I wonder if I can follow up on Audemars' question.  When you say exceeding, now is that exceeding overall? And if so, what is that number? Or is it exceeding by certain categories? And I can pull up the slides in the study if you like, but I'm pretty sure my recollection is right, that except for Native Americans, all the subcategories had exceeded availability.  That was true for Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and white women, all of their utilization was higher than availability.  So again, that was sort of a, if we're doing this well under the current setup, and we haven't been challenged in court about it, maybe just focus on making sure that we're running a good program, that people are getting paid, that we're helping them to grow rather than changing the ordinance per se, and perhaps leading to some unintended consequences.  All right, thank you.  Next, Audemars' Andre Vasquez.  Thank you very much, Chairman.  I really appreciate the presentation.  I just have a couple of few, actually really like one question.  I was part of a co-sponsor for a resolution trying to move forward in a business survey when it came to LGBTQ businesses, and trying to figure out disparity and moving forward there.  What conversations, if any, were there as far as LGBTQ communities, and potential for them being included as well as a minority? Could you share that with us? Sure, we certainly, as part of our outreach with our wonderful local subconsultant partner, Sandy Yano, some of you probably remember from her 30 plus years as the DBE Director at Metra, and we certainly did reach out to all of those groups, the LGBT contracting community, the LGBT chamber, ask them to include their members, to help us get people to come to the interviews, and fill out the survey, and ask people about that.  There are a lot of data challenges even in thinking about this


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The study found that, with the exception of Native Americans, all subcategories of minority groups had utilization rates that exceeded availability. The study recommends focusing on making sure that the program is running well, rather than changing the ordinance, to avoid unintended consequences. When it comes to LGBTQ businesses, the study recommends reaching out to all relevant groups to ensure that they are included.
