process. This means that each state may choose to allow or limit abortion as they see fit.  The Supreme Court does not have the authority to declare a constitutional right to abortion or to declare a constitutional prohibition of abortion. However, the principle of stare decisis is not absolute, and the Court may overrule a precedent if it is necessary to do so.  The three cases mentioned in the opening sentence of this passage would not have been overruled if it were not for the fact that the Supreme Court has often overruled its own earlier decisions when correction through legislative action is not possible. In the case of Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., Justice Brandeis stated that the Court has often overruled its earlier decisions in cases involving the Federal Constitution. This is still the Court's practice today. Every current Member of the Court has voted to overrule precedent, and over the last 100 years, every Justice appointed to the Court has done so as well. However, when exactly should the Court overrule an erroneous constitutional precedent? The history of stare decisis in this Court establishes that a constitutional precedent may be overruled only when (i) the prior decision is not just wrong, but is egregiously wrong, (ii) the prior decision has caused significant negative jurisprudential or real-world consequences, and (iii) overruling the prior decision would not unduly upset legitimate reliance interests. Applying those factors, it is agreed that Roe should be overruled. The Court in Roe erroneously assigned itself the authority to decide a critically important moral and policy issue that the Constitution does not grant this Court the authority to decide. As a result, Roe has caused significant negative jurisprudential and real-world consequences.  The Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade has been controversial for nearly 50 years, with many Americans and 26 states calling for it to be overturned. In 1992, the Court attempted to find common ground in the abortion debate with the Casey decision, which reaffirmed a woman's right to abortion through viability. However, this has not ended the controversy, and Justice Kavanaugh believes Roe should be overruled.  The abortion debate in the United States has been ongoing for many years, with no clear end in sight. In recent years, a number of states have passed laws restricting abortion, which directly conflict with the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade. These laws cannot be dismissed as simply political stunts or as outliers; they represent the sincere beliefs of millions of Americans who believe that allowing abortions up to 24 weeks is too radical and extreme, and does not take into account the state's interest in protecting fetal life. The question of whether or not to overturn Roe v. Wade is not dictated by Casey v. Planned Parenthood alone; other factors must be considered as well. Public opposition to Roe is one such factor. In light of this continued opposition,

The Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade has been controversial for nearly 50 years, with many Americans and 26 states calling for it to be overturned. In 1992, the Court attempted to find common ground in the abortion debate with the Casey decision, which reaffirmed a woman's right to abortion through viability. However, this has not ended the controversy, and Justice Kavanaugh believes Roe should be overruled. The abortion debate in the United States has been ongoing for many years, with no clear end in sight. In recent years, a number of states have passed laws restricting abortion, which directly conflict with the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade. These laws cannot be dismissed as simply political stunts or as outliers; they represent the sincere beliefs of millions of Americans who believe that allowing abortions up to 24 weeks is too radical and extreme, and does not take into account the state's interest in protecting fetal life. The question of whether or not to overturn Roe v. Wade is not dictated by Casey v. Planned Parenthood alone; other factors must be considered as well. Public opposition to Roe is one such factor. In light of this continued opposition, it is possible that the Supreme Court will overturn Roe in the future.
