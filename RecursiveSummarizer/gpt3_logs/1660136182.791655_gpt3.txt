The credit is also available for units that are originally placed in service more than 3 years prior to the date on which construction of the carbon capture equipment begins, but only for the 3 years with the highest annual carbon oxide production during the 12-year period preceding the date on which construction of such equipment begins.

For facilities placed in service after December 31, 2022, the applicable dollar amount is $36.
