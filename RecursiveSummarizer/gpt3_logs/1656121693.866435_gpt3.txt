J., concurring in judgment omitted)); id., at 473474 (Roe did not declare an unqualified constitutional right to an abortion, but instead protected the woman from unduly burdensome interference with her freedom to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy (internal quotation marks omitted)); Webster, 492 U. S., at 520 (plurality opinion) (Roe protects the claims of a woman to decide for herself whether or not to abort a fetus she [is] carrying); Gonzales, 550 U. S., at 146 (a State may not prohibit any woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy). If that is the basis for Roe, Roes viability line should be scrutinized from the same perspective. And there is nothing inherent in the right to choose that requires it to extend to viability or any other point, so long as a real choice is provided. See Webster, 492 U. S., at 519 (plurality opinion) (finding no reason why the States interest in protecting potential human life should come into existence only at the point of viability). To be sure, in reaffirming the right to an abortion, Casey termed the viability rule Roes central holding. 505 U. S., at 860. Other cases of ours have repeated that language. See, e.g., Gonzales, 550 U. S., at 145146. But simply declaring it does not make it so. The question in Roe was whether there was any right to abortion in the Constitution. See Brief for Appellants and Brief for Appellees, in Roe v. Wade, O. T. 1971, No. 7018. How far the right extended was a concern that was separate and subsidiary, andnot surprisinglyentirely unbriefed. The Court in Roe just chose to address both issues in one opinion: It first recognized a right to choose to terminate [a] pregnancy under the Constitution, see 410 U. S., at 129159, and then, having done so, explained that a line should be drawn at viability such that a State could not proscribe abortion before that period, see id., at 163. The viability line is a separate rule fleshing out the metes and bounds of Roes core holding. Applying principles of stare decisis, I would excise that additional ruleand only that   Cite as: 597 U.

The majority lists a number of cases that have stressed the importance of the viability rule to our abortion precedents. See ante, at 7374. I agree thatwhether it was originally holding or dictumthe viability line is clearly part of our past precedent, and the Court has applied it as such in several cases since Roe. Ante, at 73. My point is that Roe adopted two distinct rules of constitutional law: one, that a woman has the right to choose to terminate a pregnancy; two, that such right may be overridden by the States legitimate interests when the fetus is viable outside the womb. The latter is obviously distinct from the former. I would abandon that timing rule, but see no need in this case to consider the

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The U.S. Supreme Court has affirmed that a woman has a right to choose to terminate a pregnancy, but has also held that this right may be overridden by the state's legitimate interests when the fetus is viable outside the womb. In this case, the Court declined to reconsider the viability rule, but left open the possibility of doing so in the future.
