(slip op., at 2)—after more than 63 million abortions have been performed, see National Right to Life Committee, Abortion Statistics (Jan. 2022), https:// www.nrlc.org/uploads/factsheets/FS01AbortionintheUS.pdf. The harm caused by this Court’s forays into substantive due process remains immeasurable. * * * Because the Court properly applies our substantive due process precedents to reject the fabrication of a constitutional right to abortion, and because this case does not present the opportunity to reject substantive due process entirely, I join the Court’s opinion. But, in future cases, we should “follow the text of the Constitution, which sets forth certain substantive rights that cannot be taken away, and adds, beyond that, a right to due process when life, liberty, or property is to be taken away.” Carlton, 512 U. S., at 42 (opinion of Scalia, J.). Substantive due process conflicts with that textual command and has harmed our country in many ways. Accordingly, we should eliminate it from our jurisprudence at the earliest opportunity. _________________ _________________ Cite as: 597 U.

JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION, ET AL. ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT [June 24, 2022] JUSTICE KAVANAUGH, concurring. I write separately to explain my additional views about why Roe was wrongly decided, why Roe should be overruled at this time, and the future implications of today’s decision. I Abortion is a profoundly difficult and contentious issue because it presents an irreconcilable conflict between the interests of a pregnant woman who seeks an abortion and the interests in protecting fetal life. The interests on both sides of the abortion issue are extraordinarily weighty. On the one side, many pro-choice advocates forcefully argue that the ability to obtain an abortion is critically important for women’s personal and professional lives, and for women’s health. They contend that the widespread availability of abortion has been essential for women to advance in society and to achieve greater equality over the last 50 years. And they maintain that women must have the freedom to choose for themselves whether to have an abortion. On the other side, many pro-life advocates forcefully argue that a fetus is a human life. They contend that all human life should be protected as a matter of human dignity

DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

In the case of Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, the Supreme Court ruled that the use of racial preferences in government contracting was unconstitutional. In his concurring opinion, Justice Thomas argued that the Constitution does not protect a right to abortion, and that the Court's decisions in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey have caused immeasurable harm to the country. He called for the elimination of the doctrine of substantive due process, which he believes conflicts with the text of the Constitution. Today, the Supreme Court overruled Roe and Casey, two of the most controversial and divisive decisions in the Court's history. In doing so, the Court recognized the harm that has been caused by the Court's previous decisions on abortion, and affirmed the right of the States to protect fetal life. This decision will have far-reaching implications for the future of abortion in the United States.
