a clear sidewalk in the wintertime? I primarily get around by bike, but in the few times that I do walk in the wintertime, I'm an able-bodied person and I still struggle when I'm trying to carry my groceries home from the grocery store that's about three quarters of a mile from my home.  I know I'm not alone in this.  You've heard from other people here today who have been impacted.  And I know that we have the funds for the pilot program.

In the winter, I can't do that because it becomes very treacherous to try to move around just my local area.  And it's not just my mobility and accessibility for the neighborhood.
