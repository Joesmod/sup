RESPONSE:

This section of the code deals with the taxation of income from mortgage servicing contracts. It stipulates that such income may not be included in gross income under any other provision of the code until it is actually received. Additionally, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to promulgate regulations to prevent the avoidance of taxes on amounts not representing reasonable compensation for services rendered under the contract. Finally, this section provides for special adjustments to be made to income from defined benefit pension plans for tax purposes.
