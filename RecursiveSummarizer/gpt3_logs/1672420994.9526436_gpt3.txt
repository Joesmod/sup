Extract names of goverment proposals from the following text:


this resolution and appreciate your leadership.  Is there anything else we need to do? Obviously this lands in the General Assembly.  Is there a point person there who will push it or do we need to do anything further? That's the next step that our committee work is going to do, identify the right person to give this to.  And we're going to be working with the Board of Election on making sure that this gets before all of the right people, including the governor.  Alderman Burnett.  Yes.  Thank you.  I support this resolution, of course.  So just for clarification.  One, is it possible to get that that phone number.  So some of us can e-blast it and Robo call it out that people can call if they need to find their polling place.  That would be great.  Also, so again, you said that at the early voting sites in our in our wards, each of us have one.  Anybody can go there on the election day and vote, right? That is correct.  And then if they were working downtown and there was an early voting site downtown, they can go there and vote also.  That's correct.  So anybody can go to any early voting site and vote on the election day before election day and on election day.  That's correct.  So, you know, the unique thing is we're consolidating these precincts.  Like, you know, a lot of my precincts are now over a thousand people in each precinct.  Right.  And sometimes that precinct may have a polling place that's actually they may live closer to the other precincts polling place than they are to the polling places in their new precinct.  You know what I'm saying? So are we going to just make it where they can go to any precinct and vote? That would also be a state legislative change.  As it is currently, you cannot go to any precinct polling place to vote within the city of Chicago.  You can go to your assigned precinct polling place or you can go to an early voting site serving as a vote center and that any Chicago voter can go to.  All right.  Okay.  Thank you very much.
