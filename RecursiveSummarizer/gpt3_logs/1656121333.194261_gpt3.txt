deciding how abortion should be regulated. Pp. 1130. (3) Finally, the Court considers whether a right to obtain an abortion is part of a broader entrenched right that is supported by other precedents. The Court concludes the right to obtain an abortion cannot be justified as a component of such a right. Attempts to justify abortion through appeals to a broader right to autonomy and to define ones concept of existence prove too much. Casey, 505 U. S., at 851. Those criteria, at a high level of generality, could license fundamental rights to illicit drug use, prostitution, and the like. What sharply distinguishes the abortion right from the rights recognized in the cases on which Roe and Casey rely is something that both those decisions acknowledged: Abortion is different because it destroys what Roe termed potential life and what the law challenged in this case calls an unborn human being. None of the other decisions cited by Roe and Casey involved the critical moral question posed by abortion. Accordingly, those cases do not support the right to obtain an abortion, and the Courts conclusion that the Constitution does not confer such a right does not undermine them in any way. Pp. 3032. (b) The doctrine of stare decisis does not counsel continued acceptance of Roe and Casey. Stare decisis plays an important role and protects the interests of those who have taken action in reliance on a past decision. It reduces incentives for challenging settled precedents, saving parties and courts the expense of endless relitigation. Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC, 576 U. S. 446, 455. It contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process. Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827. And it restrains judicial hubris by respecting the judgment of those who grappled with important questions in the past. But stare decisis is not an inexorable command, Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 233, and is at its weakest when [the Court] interpret[s] the Constitution, Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 235. Some of the Courts most important constitutional decisions have overruled prior precedents. See, e.g., Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483, 491 (overruling the infamous decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537, and its progeny). The Courts cases have identified factors that should be considered in deciding when a precedent should be overruled. Janus v. State, County, and Municipal Employees, 585 U. S. ___, ______. Five factors  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 5 Syllabus discussed below weigh strongly in favor of overruling Roe and Casey. Pp. 3966. (1) The nature of the Courts error. Like the infamous decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, Roe was also egregiously wrong and on a collision course with the Constitution from the day it was decided. Casey perpetuated its errors, calling both sides of the national controversy to resolve their debate, but in doing so, Casey necessarily declared a winning side. Those on the losing

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that there is no right to abortion enshrined in the Constitution. This overturns the previous rulings in Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood, which had found such a right. The Court found that abortion is different from other issues because it involves the destruction of human life, and that precedent does not support the right to abortion. The Court also ruled that the doctrine of stare decisis does not require the continued acceptance of Roe and Casey, and that there are strong reasons to overturn those decisions.
