profoundly affect and, indeed, anchor individual lives. To recognize that people have relied on these rights is not to dabble in abstractions, but to acknowledge some of the most concrete and familiar aspects of human life and liberty. Ante, at 64. All those rights, like the one here, also have a societal dimension, because of the role constitutional liberties play in our structure of government. See, e.g., Dickerson, 530 U. S., at 443 (recognizing that Miranda warnings have become part of our national culture in declining to overrule Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966)). Rescinding an individual right in its entirety and conferring it on the State, an action the Court takes today for the first time in history, affects all who have relied on our constitutional system of government and its structure of individual liberties protected from state oversight. Roe and Casey have of course aroused controversy and provoked disagreement. But the right those decisions conferred and reaffirmed is part of societys understanding of constitutional law and of how the Court has defined the liberty and equality that women are entitled to claim. After today, young women will come of age with fewer  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 55 BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting rights than their mothers and grandmothers had. The majority accomplishes that result without so much as considering how women have relied on the right to choose or what it means to take that right away. The majoritys refusal even to consider the life-altering consequences of reversing Roe and Casey is a stunning indictment of its decision. D One last consideration counsels against the majoritys ruling: the very controversy surrounding Roe and Casey. The majority accuses Casey of acting outside the bounds of the law to quell the conflict over abortionof imposing an unprincipled settlement of the issue in an effort to end national division. Ante, at 67. But that is not what Casey did. As shown above, Casey applied traditional principles of stare decisiswhich the majority today ignoresin reaffirming Roe. Casey carefully assessed changed circumstances (none) and reliance interests (profound). It considered every aspect of how Roes framework operated. It adhered to the law in its analysis, and it reached the conclusion that the law required. True enough that Casey took notice of the national controversy about abortion: The Court knew in 1992, as it did in 1973, that abortion was a divisive issue. Casey, 505 U. S., at 867868; see Roe, 410 U. S., at 116. But Caseys reason for acknowledging public conflict was the exact opposite of what the majority insinuates. Casey addressed the national controversy in order to emphasize how important it was, in that case of all cases, for the Court to stick to the law. Would that todays majority had done likewise. Consider how the majority itself summarizes this aspect of Casey: The American peoples belief in the rule of law would be

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court has ruled that the right to an abortion is not absolute, and that states can place restrictions on the procedure. This decision overturns the Court's previous rulings in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which had established a woman's right to choose an abortion. The majority opinion argues that these previous decisions were wrongly decided and that they have caused division in the country. The dissent argues that the Court should not be overturning settled law without considering the consequences for women who have relied on the right to choose an abortion.
