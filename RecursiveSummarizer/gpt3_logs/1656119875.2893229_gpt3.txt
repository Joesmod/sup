In light of that worldwide liberalization of abortion laws, it is American States that will become international outliers after today. In sum, the majority can point to neither legal nor factual developments in support of its decision. Nothing that has happened in this country or the world in recent decades undermines the core insight of Roe and Casey. It continues to be true that, within the constraints those decisions established, a woman, not the government, should choose whether she will bear the burdens of pregnancy, childbirth, and parenting. 2 In support of its holding, see ante, at 40, the majority invokes two watershed cases overruling prior constitutional precedents: West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish and Brown v. Board of Education. But those decisions, unlike today’s, responded to changed law and to changed facts and attitudes that had taken hold throughout society. As Casey recognized, the two cases are relevant only to show—by stark contrast—how unjustified overturning the right to choose is. See 505 U. S., at 861–864. West Coast Hotel overruled Adkins v. Children’s Hospital —————— 21See D. Grossman, K. Grindlay, & B. Burns, Public Funding for Abortion Where Broadly Legal, 94 Contraception 451, 458 (2016) (discussing funding of abortion in European countries).   44 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting of D. C., 261 U. S. 525 (1923), and a whole line of cases beginning with Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905). Adkins had found a state minimum-wage law unconstitutional because, in the Court’s view, the law interfered with a constitutional right to contract. 261 U. S., at 554–555. But then the Great Depression hit, bringing with it unparalleled economic despair. The experience undermined—in fact, it disproved—Adkins’s assumption that a wholly unregulated market could meet basic human needs. As Justice Jackson (before becoming a Justice) wrote of that time: “The older world of laissez faire was recognized everywhere outside the Court to be dead.” The Struggle for Judicial Supremacy 85 (1941). In West Coast Hotel, the Court caught up, recognizing through the lens of experience the flaws of existing legal doctrine. See also ante, at 11 (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment). The havoc the Depression had worked on ordinary Americans, the Court noted, was “common knowledge through the length and breadth of the land.” 300 U. S., at 399. The laissez-faire approach had led to “the exploiting of workers at wages so low as to be insufficient to meet the bare cost of living.” Ibid. And since Adkins was decided, the law had also changed. In several decisions, the Court had started to recognize the power of States to implement economic policies designed to enhance their citizens’ economic well-being. See, e.g., Nebbia v. New York, 291 U. S. 502 (1934); O’Gorman & Young, Inc. v. Hartford Fire

DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

In the past 25 years, there has been a worldwide liberalization of abortion laws. As a result, the United States has become an international outlier. The majority opinion in this case can point to neither legal nor factual developments in support of its decision. The core insight of Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood continues to be true: Within the constraints established by those decisions, a woman, not the government, should choose whether she will bear the burdens of pregnancy, childbirth, and parenting. The majority opinion invokes two watershed cases—West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish and Brown v. Board of Education—in support of its holding, but those decisions are relevant only by contrast. West Coast Hotel overruled Adkins v. Children's Hospital of D. C., and a whole line of cases beginning with Lochner v. New York, while Brown overruled Plessy v. Ferguson. In both cases, the Court responded to changed law and to changed facts and attitudes that had taken hold throughout society. The experience of the Great Depression undermined the assumption that a wholly unregulated market could meet basic human needs, and the Court caught up with this new reality in West Coast Hotel. In Brown, the Court recognized that the "separate but equal" doctrine of Plessy v. Ferguson was untenable in light of the changed social and legal landscape. The majority opinion in this case, by contrast, fails to take account of either changed law or changed facts and attitudes. It is out of step with the rest of the world, and it fails to provide a compelling justification for overturning the right to choose.
