study community effects study, as well as an amendment that was promised already where we're just talking about planning so I want to reiterate a question because I don't.  I don't see that and the answer to what's provided is not satisfactory to us around the study for the environment, both and also you know the amendment for the Chicago church or amendment because you talk about planning, you talk about a pro bono study.  How in a $16 billion budget we cannot have a fully funded for both of them.

So, the pro bono scope for the study is tied to the best governance structure for the office plus the
