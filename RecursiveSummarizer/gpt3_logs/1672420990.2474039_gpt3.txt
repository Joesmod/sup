it easier for new members as well as existing members to carry out the functionality of opening an office, I would appreciate that.  The other thing that I wanted to ask, two of my colleagues referenced the migrant situation.  I know that AIS has taken the lead and it's a kind of an uncharted territory for you.  A couple questions I have for that is, first off, will your department be able to provide us who's paying for all of these renovations going on throughout the city of Chicago? You don't have to give me the specific today, but if I could just get a yes or no commitment to share through the chair, whoever, who's paying for what these sites are costing taxpayers, I'm assuming it's us paying.  And as well, what we're doing in terms of giving some financial support to partnering organizations, I would appreciate that.  Additionally, the quality of care I think needs to be addressed because I'm hearing, and perhaps you could shed some light on this, serving in the role already, is that we have situations where you have guards acting inappropriately with some of the individuals under their protection.  We have individuals who are washing clothes in outdoor bathrooms, things of that nature.  So I'd love to know what the standard of care for individuals that we are housing is at every location.  And it doesn't have to be today, but clearly since I got you in the seat, I'm going to ask you right now.  But look forward to working with you to address these concerns and all the other AIS related matters.  And just know you have great people here in the box on 39 Street and throughout the city doing a great job representing your department as well.  So thank you, Madam Chairman.  Thank you, Alderman.  Thank you, Alderman.  I think that your questions regarding care and follow up on the migrants could be addressed to the Brandy Kanazi, the Commissioner of the Department of Family and Support Services after this meeting.  Okay.  Alderman Brookins.  Thank you, Madam
