It is hard to know how anyone would evaluate such a claim and as we have described above, the majoritys reasoning does not rely on any reevaluation of the interest in protecting fetal life.

Sixty-two percent of pregnancies in Mississippi are unplanned, yet Mississippi does not require insurance to cover contraceptives and prohibits educators from demonstrating proper contraceptive use.19 The State neither bans pregnancy discrimination nor requires provision of paid parental leave.

Although 86 percent of pregnancy-related deaths in the State are due to postpartum complications, Mississippi rejected federal funding to provide a years worth of Medicaid coverage to women after giving birth. See Brief for Yale Law School 1213. Perhaps unsurprisingly, health outcomes in Mississippi are abysmal for both women and children. Mississippi has the highest infant mortality rate in the country,  the 1970s, long before Casey. Today, 60 percent of women seeking abortions have at least one child, and one-third have two or more. See CDC, K. Kortsmit et al., Abortion SurveillanceUnited States, 2019, 70 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 6 (2021).
