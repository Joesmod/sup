PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


African American African Americans are Blacks under a Hispanics under b Asian Americans under c American Indians under d.  Um did I capture everybody who was there? Well yeah I mean American Indians and under I individual members of other groups including but not limited to Arab Americans um so that could be done under minority by adding that one which would not expand the pool by using the term diverse.  By using the term diverse you create a situation where minorities can continue to be discriminated against.  Google it Google Google the definitions.  Can we can we this was not socialized or discussed at all in our management in our management briefings and I think this requires more back and forth more dialogue and so I'm going to ask you if we can take this out and move forward with everything else.  That's my cause and while they're considering that um the the the second part um on page 10 uh with the low bidder as opposed to the lowest responsible bidder um the contract values these are things that they that we should be discussing that are all additions to this point.  Okay all right moving on this requires a lot of this requires some conversation.  All right so under section 13 uh sub b submit a debt check application what is that? Um I'm gonna as opposed to the affidavit they took out the affidavit.  Yes um I'm gonna ask the comptroller to just clarify the difference.  Thank you.  Rishmasoni city comptroller.  So the debt check section is for a process that we're already doing.  All employees new employees that join the city do go through a debt check process and then either we put them on a payment plan or they can pay in full whatever they prefer.  This is to clarify and and allow that volunteers would not have to go through the debt check process as long as they're not a part of a commission.  Okay and then why did we choose to get rid of the affidavit and do the debt check application is that just modernizing it or? Yes so to your point Alderman


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The African American, Hispanic, Asian American, and American Indian groups are all considered minorities. However, by using the term "diverse," you create a situation where minorities can continue to be discriminated against. The comptroller clarified that the debt check section is for a process that the city already does for all new employees, and that volunteers would not have to go through the debt check process as long as they're not a part of a commission.
