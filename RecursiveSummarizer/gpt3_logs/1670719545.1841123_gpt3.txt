Smith provides, but, if she did provide that, if it's a plug-and-play website where the couple, for example, is putting in their names and -- and using their website, then you don't have compelled speech because you don't have a speech creator. But even in the context of putting in names -- JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: I'm sorry. Show me on your website -- show me in -- on the pages of your petition for a writ of certiorari, show me a page on that website that is an endorsement of a marriage as opposed to the story of a couple.

I'm looking at every page, and, basically, it's the story of the couple. It's a date on page 51. Fifty-two is "Our Special Day." Fifty-three is RSVP. "Our Photo Gallery."

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court is hearing a case about whether a wedding website violates the Compelled Speech Doctrine by compelling speech from the couple. Justice Sotomayor is questioning the attorney for the website, asking her to show how the website is anything other than the story of the couple. The attorney cannot provide a satisfactory answer.
