PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


all these different grant programs have different expiration dates.  And we can provide that through the chair, and of course we need to know those as well because there's a lot of us, you know, and I think it's no secret that I've complained about not getting things done right like things are not flowing.  Whether it at PVC where in some of these other areas where they're waiting for projects and nothing's happening.  So I'm not sure if it's a procurement I know it's not the funding funding is there.  So I don't know if it's the procurement or just the fact that you have a flow of bureaucracy of why we're failing to sort of meet that that moment.  So we like a little more information on that.  And Alderman, I just have to say this, you know, we have been having quarterly budget hearings on the ARP money, and through the budget committee on what has been allocated what has been spent by various program categories, all of those reports get sent out, and we've had an opportunity to come to those.  And I'm chair I digress, so there's been an expanded there's been an allocation of resources.  We're not seeing the impact on the other side.  Okay, that's that different is that a little bit different.  Because that's what I'm talking about I guess I'm I digress on that so yes, the money got there and we said okay let's spend it let's do it let's do that.  And then like, nothing.  I'm asking where is the problem, not, not a budgetary problem I guess is a, it's a people problem right.  That's that's all I'm saying, Madam Chair.  So, let's get to the Office of Climate and Environmental Equity position and I've made this clear from other times or where I've been interviewed many times about the environmental department that was supposed to have been created.  I'll take incremental change.  You know, over 20 years I've gotten projects done it's taken me seven years, eight years, some 10 years.  So I'm a patient man.  But at some point, this has to be a pivot to that
