Write a concise summary of the following:


whether it's infrastructure, whether it's services.  So there is a coordinating body that all of us are working with.  I would appreciate if you get that I did ask during budget to us and I'll make sure we're that I don't see that through the chair.  I don't see that but I've been asking for that.  Okay, I'll just, I'll make sure that like to see that.  And how much was allocated for gun violence prevention.  Last year for violence prevention, I believe, last year, or this coming in 2022 are you asking for 2021 this year 2022 I'm sorry.  I would have to probably get that through the chair I do think it's over 100 million, double check right.  And how much have we spent to date that allocated spent.  Um, that's also a number I'll have to get through the chair for you.  You know, have we spent 5 million.  Yeah, I can probably assume.  Yes, I'm sure we've spent 5 million.  Number two, but I don't want to give you a wrong number on the record.  But, yeah, we, I think you responded to it last time that it's it was on a document that it's like around or less than 5 million I don't, I don't even I think that's what's appropriate it but we haven't spent it.  But that also speaks to why we need somebody who's controlling that effort so we can get that money out the door.  And so now we've reallocated the money that we haven't spent which is around 80 million over this year and next year I just want to keep emphasizing that we need to get that money out the door, and we need somebody who's in charge of, of doing that.  For alternative responses to 911, I guess what you guys are calling the care program.  Are we increasing that funding.  So there is funding in the CRP for that.  That is working through that expansion so I believe that's 15 million that we have going into 2023 for the expansion of the care in program.  And how much how much have we allocated this year.  My my belief and I know, Commissioner wadi might be back there who might know but I so we're working through
