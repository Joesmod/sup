ATVs.  US EPA has added the site to the Superfund national priorities list which will allow the US EPA to clean up the contaminated site.  The goal is to construct a barrier and fence along the access areas.  The city will arrange for installation of the barrier system along the south end of the shroud site.  Thank you.  Any questions from members of the committee? Alderman Garza is in support of this change.  Can I get a motion to recommend approval of this item by the affirmative vote of all members present to determine form in the roll call? So moved Mr.  Chairman.  All the way down.  All the way down so moves hearing no objections so ordered do pass recommendation of this ordinance reported out of the next city council meeting.  It is the intention of the chair to recess the housing and real estate committee till two o'clock and next Monday the 19th.  I will notify everyone on how we proceed but it's the intention of the chair to recess until two o'clock on Monday September 19th.  See no further business before the members of the committee.  Chair, it's great again I apologize.  If we're able to work it out with the law department before the 19th might we be able to get the substitute on the ordinance then that would still be a couple of days before full council.  So I think I just did that.  So I have to recess the committee to a date and time certain.  I think that next Monday is a date and time where there are no present committee meetings and I'd like to recess that until this time.  The members of the committee would come back if there is action before and if not I would reopen the committee and gavel out and adjourn.  So I think that is the course that the committee is going to take.  Thank you and I rule myself out of order but thanks for entertaining me.  Chairman.  No you got the mic, Graham.  So see no further business before the committee today.  We'll be recessed until next Monday the 19th.  Everyone have a safe day.  Thank you.
