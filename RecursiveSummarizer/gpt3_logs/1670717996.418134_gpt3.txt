PROMPT:

Write an explanation as to how the following will benefit the City:


opportunity to live in an area and i also have a portable place to stay uh...  in the same area again this is uh...  in a very or call it isolated but in a in the south east corner of the i am d are right at thirteen from hasting as we have the verde port across the street cost go down the block and we have a vast array of of land that we believe or will become a part of a life science hub uh...  that will rival any in the country is having that you gotta have viable places for people to live and so this is a meeting help to meet that goal and that as forty committees favorable consideration thank you we have a question about the most part of our problem more thank you so much not so much on on the project but on the ordinance because really this is one of the most unsung tools we have right now for treating affordable housing so let's take advantage of the moment on in terms of the low affordability zones last time we did it i think by pin previously by pin but could you talk a little bit just to question sir uh...  about the process of the portability areas by census tract is that a one-at-a-time or could you do it designate multiple census tracts in a space where you wanted to encourage deeply affordable housing uh...  yes uh...  cancer uh...  so low affordability communities can be designated by pin or by census tract and there's no prohibition on designating multiple pins or multiple census tracks uh...  city of chicago is a home rule municipality and it's within your authority to do so thank you uh...  i wanted to ask if you would go back to a slide you had because this is not just about new construction this is about rehabbing multifamily housing as well there's been some confusion in the developer community at least in my ward about what level of rehab you have to see in order to qualify some folks talk about a number of systems being replaced in the building i think i saw a dollar amount per square foot that's required could you share a little bit more


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The proposed ordinance will benefit the City by providing an opportunity for more affordable housing. Developers will be able to rehab existing multifamily housing and receive a tax break for doing so. This will help to meet the goal of providing viable places for people to live.
