But even on that view, such a right would need to be rooted in the Nations history and tradition. See Corfield v. Coryell, 6 F. Cas. 546, 551552 (No. 3,230) (CC ED Pa. 1823) (describing unenumerated rights under the Privileges and Immunities Clause, Art. IV, 2, as those fundamental rights which have, at all times, been enjoyed by the citizens of the several states); Amar 176 (relying on Corfield to interpret the Privileges or Immunities Clause); cf. McDonald, 561 U. S., at 819820, 832, 854 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (reserving the question whether the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects any rights besides those enumerated in the Constitution). 23See R.

JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court Not only was there no support for such a constitutional right until shortly before Roe, but abortion had long been a crime in every single State. At common law, abortion was criminal in at least some stages of pregnancy and was regarded as unlawful and could have very serious consequences at all stages. American law followed the common law until a wave of statutory restrictions in the 1800s expanded criminal liability for abortions. By the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, three-quarters of the States had made abortion a crime at any stage of pregnancy, and the remaining States would soon follow. Roe either ignored or misstated this history, and Casey declined to reconsider Roes faulty historical analysis. It is therefore important to set the record straight. 2 a We begin with the common law, under which abortion was a crime at least after quickeningi.e., the first felt movement of the fetus in the womb, which usually occurs between the 16th and 18th week of pregnancy.24  articulate on paper the argument that a womans right to choose abortion was a fundamental individual freedom protected by the U. S. Constitutions guarantee of personal liberty). 24The exact meaning of quickening is subject to some debate. Compare Brief for Scholars of Jurisprudence as Amici Curiae 1214, and n. 32 (emphasis deleted) ( a quick child  meant simply a live child, and under the eras outdated knowledge of embryology, a fetus was thought to become quick at around the sixth week of pregnancy), with Brief for American Historical Association et al. as Amici Curiae 6, n. 2 (quick and quickening consistently meant the womans perception of fetal movement). We need not wade into this debate. First, it suffices for present purposes to show that abortion was criminal by at least the 16th or 18th week of

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

This article discusses the history of abortion in the United States. It explains that at common law, abortion was criminalized at some point during pregnancy, and that this law was carried forward into the 1800s when many states began to expand criminal liability for abortions. The article then argues that the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade was based on a faulty historical analysis.
