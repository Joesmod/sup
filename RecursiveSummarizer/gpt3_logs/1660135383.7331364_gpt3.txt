RESPONSE:

This section deals with the treatment of cooperative organizations and their patrons for purposes of the tax credit for renewable energy facilities. Specifically, it provides that the amount of the credit apportioned to any patrons of an eligible cooperative shall not be included in the amount of the credit determined for the organization, and shall instead be included in the patron's own tax return. In addition, if the amount of the credit determined for a cooperative organization is less than the amount shown on the organization's return, the difference will be treated as an increase in tax imposed on the organization.
