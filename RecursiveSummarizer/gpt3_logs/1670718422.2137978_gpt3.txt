==========

RESPONSE:

The city is proposing to spend money to acquire a vacant hotel and an adjacent vacant parcel, in order to redevelop the area. The hotel is in poor condition and would need significant renovations, while the vacant parcel is just empty land. The two sites together make up a total of 13,860 square feet. The owners of both properties have been notified of the city's plans. The goal of the redevelopment plan is to attract private investment and reduce blight in the area.
