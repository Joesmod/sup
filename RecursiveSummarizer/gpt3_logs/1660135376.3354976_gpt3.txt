CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The section allows for qualified facilities to receive clean electricity production credits, provided that the electricity is produced within the United States. Additionally, any combined heat and power system property within the facility will also be taken into account for the purposes of determining the greenhouse gas emissions rate.
