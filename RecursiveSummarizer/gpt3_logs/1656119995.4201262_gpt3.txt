RESPONSE:

In its decision in Janus v. AFSCME, the Supreme Court held that requiring public employees to pay fees to a union violates the First Amendment. This decision overruled the Court's previous decision in Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed. The Court based its decision on "both factual and legal" developments that had "eroded the decision's underpinnings and left it an outlier among our First Amendment cases." The Court noted that there had been a significant change in the legal landscape since Abood was decided, with a number of cases coming out against mandatory union fees. The Court also noted that there had been a change in social understanding of the role of unions, with unions no longer being seen as solely benefiting employees, but also benefiting the employers. The Court held that the First Amendment does not allow for mandatory union fees, and that the only way to ensure that public employees are not forced to pay for union activities that they do not support is to overturn Abood.
