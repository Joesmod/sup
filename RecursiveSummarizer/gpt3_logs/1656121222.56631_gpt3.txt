RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court is currently considering whether the right to abortion is fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty and deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition. To answer this question, the history of abortion must be examined. Abortion has been practiced throughout history, but it was not until the 19th century that it began to be regulated. In 1821, Connecticut became the first state to enact a law criminalizing abortion. This law, and the others that followed, were motivated by a desire to protect women's health and safety, as well as by a belief that abortion was morally wrong. The first half of the 20th century saw a gradual liberalization of abortion laws in the United States. By the mid-1960s, nearly half of the states had liberalized their laws to some extent. The 1973 Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade recognized a woman's right to abortion, basing this right on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Since Roe was decided, there has been a continued effort to overturn it or restrict its scope. In 1992, the Court's decision in Planned Parenthood v.
