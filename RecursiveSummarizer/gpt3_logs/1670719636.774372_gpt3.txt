to the public, yes. JUSTICE ALITO: Okay. So what does "open to the public" mean? Does that mean no selectivity whatsoever? Anybody who wants this service can get it and it may be, if there's a greater demand, then the demand exceeds the supply, you've got to wait in line. But, if there's any selectivity at all, they're out? MR. OLSON: Well, again, it's not presented in this case. The way that Colorado has historically addressed that question is -- are, say, golf clubs who had limited their membership to one gender, you know, did they make money from the public coming to their courses, did they -- did you have to be a member Heritage Reporting Corporation                           1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 70 Official - Subject to Final Review to dine in the restaurant, et cetera.

Is it a public accommodation then? MR.

What it can't do is say I reserve the right to refuse service which means in practice I will not serve black people.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

In the conversation, the Justices are trying to determine whether a website designer who only provides services to certain people based on their demand is considered a public accommodation. Mr. Olson argues that as long as the website designer is not discriminating based on protected characteristics, then they are allowed to choose their clientele.
