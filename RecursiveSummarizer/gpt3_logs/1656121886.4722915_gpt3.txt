And five Justices acceded to that cynical maneuver. They let Texas defy this Courts constitutional rulings, nullifying Roe and Casey ahead of schedule in the Nations second largest State. And now the other shoe drops, courtesy of that same fiveperson majority. (We believe that THE CHIEF JUSTICEs opinion is wrong too, but no one should think that there is not a large difference between upholding a 15-week ban on the grounds he does and allowing States to prohibit abortion from the time of conception.) Now a new and bare majority of this Courtacting at practically the first moment possibleoverrules Roe and Casey. It converts a series of dissenting opinions expressing antipathy toward Roe and Casey into a decision greenlighting even total abortion bans. See ante, at 57, 59, 63, and nn. 6164 (relying on former dissents). It eliminates a 50-year-old constitutional right that safeguards womens freedom and equal station. It breaches a core rule-of-law principle, designed to promote constancy in the law. In doing all of that, it places in jeopardy other rights, from contraception to same-sex intimacy and marriage. And finally, it undermines the Courts legitimacy.

Just as we did here, Casey explained the importance of stare decisis; the inappositeness of West Coast Hotel and Brown; the absence of any changed circumstances (or other reason) justifying the reversal of precedent. 505 U.

[T]he Court, Casey explained, could not pretend that overruling Roe had any justification beyond a present doctrinal disposition to come out differently from the Court of 1973. 505 U. S., at 864.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that legalized abortion, in a 5-4 decision. The Court's conservative majority ruled that states can ban abortion from the time of conception. This ruling will have a major impact on women's reproductive rights and could lead to more states banning abortion altogether.
