That case was not just about access to the law schools' rooms. The law schools had a separate claim that said we provide other services to recruiters in the  form of e-mails, newsletters, other things of that nature. And this Court did not disagree. It said those things are clearly speech. And the law schools also said, when we are required to provide those services to the military, it changes our message because it forces us to support a cause we deeply oppose. And this Court did not disagree. Instead, it said that compulsion of speech is permissible because it's incidental to a content-neutral regulation of conduct and that law schools are required to speak only if and to the extent they would provide the same speech for others. I welcome the Court's questions.

In what  other case have we upheld compelling speech, in other words, not simply just restricting speech but actually compelling an individual to engage  in speech contrary to her beliefs?  MR. FLETCHER: So I think, Mr. Chief Justice, Rumsfeld really is one of those cases.  And I want to emphasize that the law schools there really did have a very credible claim, I think, that they deeply opposed the military's policies and that -- CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Well, they opposed the military's policies, but all they really had to do was give them an


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The speaker explains that the Supreme Court's decision in Rumsfeld v. FAIR was based on the fact that the law schools in that case were required to provide the same speech and services to the military as they would to any other recruiter, and that this was incidental to a content-neutral regulation of conduct.
