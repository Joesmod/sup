contract goals, the contract is assessed on if they, that's a contract goal.  So it has to be, they can be achieved over the life of the contract.  However, the Department of the Commerce Service at our pre-bid meeting always encouraged the JOC contractor to meet the goals of the project on each project because they never know how they can make up the shortfall because they don't know what the next project is going to be or the amount.  What DPS does is, but any contract, any project that's being recommended by the department is over a million dollars, part of the MOA is reviewed.  And if approved, the Department of the Commerce Service makes that approval conditional.  That condition of approval is that the MBE goals must be met on this particular project.  The contractor don't get the option of saying that they're going to be there on a future project.  So any value of a JOC order request, it comes to exceeds a million dollars, a million dollars all over, then that is approved, is approved on the condition that the MBE goals be met on that particular project.

I'm Deputy Commissioner for AIS.  Thank you for your time today.  We also have Mr.  Gary Bell from our contracts team at AIS as well.  So just to give you a briefing of our JOC program, as Mr.  Whitaker listed earlier, there are four JOC contracts for general construction that were awarded in 2021.  These are for projects, facility projects of emergency nature, immediate needs, and deferred maintenance for all of our citywide facilities.  The timeline for procuring a project with our JOC program really aligns with our day-to-day needs and the responsiveness that's required to the departments we support.  So this is a really effective tool for us in terms of being able to respond immediately and when time constraints are in front of

RESPONSE:

The JOC program is a way for the city to respond immediately to construction needs for facilities. The four JOC contracts were awarded in 2021 and cover projects for all citywide facilities. The program is effective because it allows for a quick response to time constraints.
