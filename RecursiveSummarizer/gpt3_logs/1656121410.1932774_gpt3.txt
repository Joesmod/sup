On the contrary, an unbroken tradition of prohibiting abortion on pain of criminal punishment persisted from the earliest days of the common law until 1973. The Court in Roe could have said of abortion exactly what Glucksberg said of assisted suicide: Attitudes toward [abortion] have changed since Bracton, but our laws have consistently condemned, and continue to prohibit, [that practice]. 521 U. S., at 719. 3 Respondents and their amici have no persuasive answer to this historical evidence. Neither respondents nor the Solicitor General disputes the fact that by 1868 the vast majority of States criminalized abortion at all stages of pregnancy. See Brief for Petitioners 1213; see also Brief for American Historical Association et al. as Amici Curiae 2728, and nn. 1415 (conceding that 26 out of 37 States prohibited abortion before quickening); Tr. of Oral Arg. 7475 (respondents counsel conceding the same). Instead, respondents are forced to argue that it does [not] matter that some States prohibited abortion at the time Roe was decided or when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted. Brief for Respondents 21. But that argument flies in the face of the standard we have applied in determining whether an asserted right that is nowhere mentioned in the Constitution is nevertheless protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. Not only are respondents and their amici unable to show  26 DOBBS v.

The earliest sources called to our attention are a few district court and state court decisions decided shortly before Roe and a small number of law review articles from the same time period.36 A few of respondents amici muster historical arguments, but they are very weak. The Solicitor General repeats Roes claim that it is doubtful . . . abortion was ever firmly established as a common-law crime even with respect to the destruction of a quick fetus. Brief for United States 26 (quoting Roe, 410 U. S., at 136). But as we have seen, great common-law authorities like Bracton, Coke, Hale, and Blackstone all wrote that a post-quickening abortion was a crimeand a serious one at that. Moreover, Hale and Blackstone (and many other authorities following them) asserted that even a pre-quickening abortion was unlawful and that, as a result, an abortionist was guilty of murder if the woman died from the attempt. Instead of following these authorities, Roe relied largely on two articles by a pro-abortion advocate who claimed that Coke had intentionally misstated the common law because of his strong anti-abortion views.37 These articles have  36See 410 U.

RESPONSE:

The Court in Roe v. Wade could have said that the law has consistently condemned abortion, but instead relied on two articles by a pro-abortion advocate. These articles have been debunked by subsequent scholarship.
