dissenting cisis protection.28 This unprecedented assertion is, at bottom, a radical claim to power. By disclaiming any need to consider broad swaths of individuals interests, the Court arrogates to itself the authority to overrule established legal principles without even acknowledging the costs of its decisions for the individuals who live under the law, costs that this Courts stare decisis doctrine instructs us to privilege when deciding whether to change course. The majority claims that the reliance interests women have in Roe and Casey are too intangible for the Court to consider, even if it were inclined to do so. Ante, at 65. This is to ignore as judges what we know as men and women. The interests women have in Roe and Casey are perfectly, viscerally concrete. Countless women will now make different decisions about careers, education, relationships, and whether to try to become pregnant than they would have when Roe served as a backstop. Other women will carry pregnancies to term, with all the costs and risk of harm that involves, when they would previously have chosen to obtain an abortion. For millions of women, Roe and Casey have been critical in giving them control of their bodies and their lives. Closing our eyes to the suffering todays decision will impose will not make that suffering disappear. The majority cannot escape its obligation to count[] the cost[s] of its decision by invoking the conflicting arguments of contending sides. Casey, 505 U. S., at 855; ante, at 65. Stare decisis requires that the Court calculate the costs of a decisions repudiation on those who have relied on the decision,  28The majoritys sole citation for its concreteness requirement is Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808 (1991). But Payne merely discounted reliance interests in cases involving procedural and evidentiary rules. Id., at 828. Unlike the individual right at stake here, those rules do not alter primary conduct. Hohn v. United States, 524 U. S. 236, 252 (1998). Accordingly, they generally do not implicate the reliance interests of private parties at all. Alleyne v. United States, 570 U. S. 99, 119 (2013) (SOTOMAYOR, J., concurring).  54 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting not on those who have disavowed it. See Casey, 505 U. S., at 855. More broadly, the majoritys approach to reliance cannot be reconciled with our Nations understanding of constitutional rights. The majoritys insistence on a concrete, economic showing would preclude a finding of reliance on a wide variety of decisions recognizing constitutional rights such as the right to express opinions, or choose whom to marry, or decide how to educate children. The Court, on the majoritys logic, could transfer those choices to the State without having to consider a persons settled understanding that the law makes them hers. That must be wrong. All those rights, like the right to obtain an abortion,

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Court's decision today is a radical claim to power, disregarding the interests of women who have relied on Roe and Casey to make decisions about their lives. The majority cannot escape its obligation to consider the costs of its decision on those who have relied on it, and its insistence on a concrete, economic showing would preclude a finding of reliance on a wide variety of decisions recognizing constitutional rights.
