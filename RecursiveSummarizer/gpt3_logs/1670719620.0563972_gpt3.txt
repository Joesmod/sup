Granting such a license to discriminate  would empower all businesses that offer what  they believe to be expressive services, from architects to photographers to consultants, to refuse service to customers because of their disability, sexual orientation, religion, or race. The Free Speech Clause exemption the company seeks here is sweeping because it would apply not just to sincerely held religious beliefs, like those of the company and its owner, but also to all sorts of racist, sexist, and bigoted views. This rule would allow another web design company to say no interracial couples served, an ad agency could refuse women-led businesses, and a tech consulting company could refuse to serve 303 Creative itself because it disagreed with the owner's religion.

RESPONSE:

This case is about a web design company that is refusing to sell its services to a same-sex couple. The company is arguing that this is a free speech issue and that they should be exempt from public accommodation laws. However, the Supreme Court has previously ruled that public accommodation laws apply to all businesses, regardless of their type of service. Therefore, the company should not be exempt from these laws.
