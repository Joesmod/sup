Write a concise summary of the following:

Roe entirely. The Court will consider whether the right to obtain an abortion is part of a broader entrenched right that is supported by other precedents.  The Court in Roe v. Wade found that the right to abortion springs from at least five different constitutional provisions, and that it could be rooted in the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, or Fourteenth Amendments. The Court in Casey v. Planned Parenthood did not defend Roe's unfocused analysis, and instead grounded its decision solely on the theory that the right to obtain an abortion is part of the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. However, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not apply to abortion, as it is not a sex-based classification.  The Court has held that laws regulating or prohibiting abortion are not subject to heightened scrutiny, but are instead governed by the same standard of review as other health and safety measures. The Court has also held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects two categories of substantive rights: those guaranteed by the first eight Amendments, and a select list of fundamental rights that are not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution. In order to determine whether a right falls into either of these categories, the Court asks whether the right is deeply rooted in our history and tradition and whether it is essential to our Nation's scheme of ordered liberty.  The Fourteenth Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms, as well as other rights not expressly mentioned in the Constitution. This was established in McDonald v. Chicago, which held that the right to keep and bear arms is a fundamental right necessary to our system of ordered liberty.  The Supreme Court has ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment does not protect the right to an abortion. This is because there is no support in American law for such a right.  This article discusses the history of abortion in the United States. It explains that at common law, abortion was criminalized at some point during pregnancy, and that this law was carried forward into the 1800s when many states began to expand criminal liability for abortions. The article then argues that the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade was based on a faulty historical analysis.  The English common law treated abortion as a crime, regardless of whether the fetus was quickened (i.e., when it first showed signs of life). This remained the case in America up until the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The English common law did not condone abortion, even before quickening, and considered it a form of homicide. This is confirmed by a proto-felony-murder rule which held that even if a physician performed an abortion with no intention of harming the woman, if she died as a result, it was still murder.  The act of procuring an abortion, or of putting skewers into a woman for the purpose of abortion, is murder. This has been clearly held by courts in
