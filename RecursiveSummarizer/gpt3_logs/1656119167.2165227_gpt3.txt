notion of reliance thus finds little support in our cases, which instead emphasize very concrete reliance interests, like those that develop in “cases involving property and contract rights.” Payne, 501 U.

That form of reliance depends on an empirical question that is hard for anyone—and in particular, for a court—to assess, namely, the effect of the abortion right on society and in particular on the lives of women. The contending sides in this case make impassioned and conflicting arguments about the effects of the abortion right on the lives of women.

The contending sides also make conflicting arguments about the status of the fetus. This Court has neither the authority nor the expertise to adjudicate those disputes, and the Casey plurality’s speculations and weighing of the relative importance of the fetus and mother represent a departure from the “original constitutional proposition” that “courts do not substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies.” Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U. S. 726, 729–730 (1963). Our decision returns the issue of abortion to those legislative bodies, and it allows women on both sides of the abortion issue to seek to affect the legislative process by influencing public opinion, lobbying legislators, voting, and running for office. Women are not without electoral or political power. It is noteworthy that the percentage of women who register to vote and cast ballots is consistently higher than the percentage of men who do so.66 In the last election in November 2020, women, who make up around 51.5 percent of the population of Mississippi,67 constituted —————— 66See Dept. of Commerce, U.

DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The opinion of the court in this case concerns the constitutionality of Mississippi's abortion ban. The ban prohibits abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with no exceptions for cases of rape or incest. The court first reviews the history of abortion regulation in the United States, noting that prior to Roe v. Wade, abortion was generally prohibited. The court then reviews the holding in Roe, which found that the right to abortion was implicit in the right to privacy. The court next reviews the holding in Casey, which reaffirmed Roe's holding that the right to abortion was constitutionally protected, but also held that states could place restrictions on abortion so long as those restrictions did not place an undue burden on the woman's right to choose. The court then turns to the issue at hand, which is whether Mississippi's abortion ban is constitutional. The court first notes that the ban is not supported by the notion of reliance, which the court says is little supported by precedent. The court then turns to the question of whether the ban places an undue burden on the woman's right to choose, and finds that it does. The court notes that the ban does not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest, and that it would effectively outlaw abortion in the state. The court concludes that the ban is unconstitutional and strikes it down.
