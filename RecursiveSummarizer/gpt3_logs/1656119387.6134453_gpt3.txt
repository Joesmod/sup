S. 26, 40 (1994) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). The resolution of this case is thus straightforward. Because the Due Process Clause does not secure any substantive rights, it does not secure a right to abortion. The Court today declines to disturb substantive due process jurisprudence generally or the doctrine’s application in other, specific contexts. Cases like Griswold v. Connecticut, Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 3 THOMAS, J., concurring 381 U. S. 479 (1965) (right of married persons to obtain contraceptives)*; Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558 (2003) (right to engage in private, consensual sexual acts); and Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U. S. 644 (2015) (right to same-sex marriage), are not at issue. The Court’s abortion cases are unique, see ante, at 31–32, 66, 71–72, and no party has asked us to decide “whether our entire Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence must be preserved or revised,” McDonald, 561 U. S., at 813 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). Thus, I agree that “[n]othing in [the Court’s] opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion.” Ante, at 66. For that reason, in future cases, we should reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents, including Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell. Because any substantive due process decision is “demonstrably erroneous,” Ramos v. Louisiana, 590 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 7), we have a duty to “correct the error” established in those precedents, Gamble v. United States, 587 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (slip op., at 9). After overruling these demonstrably erroneous decisions, the question would remain whether other constitutional provisions guarantee the myriad rights that our substantive due process cases have generated. For example, we could consider whether any of the rights announced in this Court’s substantive due process cases are “privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States” protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. Amdt. —————— *Griswold v. Connecticut purported not to rely on the Due Process Clause, but rather reasoned “that specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights”—including rights enumerated in the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth Amendments—“have penumbras, formed by emanations,” that create “zones of privacy.” 381 U. S., at 484. Since Griswold, the Court, perhaps recognizing the facial absurdity of Griswold’s penumbral argument, has characterized the decision as one rooted in substantive due process. See, e.g., Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U. S. 644, 663 (2015); Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702, 720 (1997).    4 DOBBS v.

DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Court today overrules Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), and its progeny, which recognized a woman’s right to abortion. The Court does so on the grounds that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not protect any substantive rights, and therefore does not protect a woman’s right to abortion. The Court also declines to disturb its substantive due process jurisprudence generally, or the application of that jurisprudence in other specific contexts. In overruling Roe, the Court acknowledges that its decision will have far-reaching implications, both legal and practical. Legally, the Court’s decision means that abortion will no longer be a constitutional right, and states will be free to criminalize abortion or to regulate it as they see fit. Practically, the Court’s decision is likely to lead to a patchwork of state laws governing abortion, with some states banning it outright and others continuing to allow it with few or no restrictions. The Court’s decision is likely to be controversial, and it will undoubtedly be met with criticism from those who believe that a woman’s right to choose what to do with her own body is a fundamental right. However, the Court’s decision is based on a straightforward application of the law, and it is difficult to see how the Court could have reached any other conclusion.
