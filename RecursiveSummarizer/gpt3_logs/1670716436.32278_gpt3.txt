PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


franchises work.  When black communities, black community flies when black businessmen like myself are working.  Also, we set a tone.  I was able to help an Ottoman microscot to design a community training workshop that the Ottoman Scott had provided the facility.  And out of pocket, no grunts, anything like that.  I just thought the need, I just thought the obligation to train some of our youth.  I have photos and all of that to verify.  I have documentation where we were able to reach back and give our young men and women some hope.

OK, let me thank all the Alderman's that are doing this, because this is a big deal for us.

And one of the things is that, like some of the speakers said before me, Alderman, is that the Section 3 program was the program to bring a young man or young woman up from by the bootstrap.  They were able to get a job.  They were able to get a contract.  They were able to help their family live day to day.  We talking about from the south or the west side, one thing that really made me very impressive was that it was 20 young men that came by Rainbow Push, which I was having
