DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The majority opinion in this case notes the availability of insurance coverage and healthcare services, but points out that these may be far away from many women, who continue to face pregnancy discrimination that interferes with their ability to earn a living. Paid family leave remains inaccessible to many who need it most. Only 20 percent of private-sector workers have access to paid family leave, including a mere 8 percent of workers in the bottom quartile of wage earners. The majority briefly notes the growing prevalence of safe haven laws and demand for adoption, but points out that these are irrelevant to the health risks or financial costs of going through pregnancy and childbirth. The choice to give up parental rights after giving birth is altogether different from the choice not to carry a pregnancy to term. The reality is that few women denied an abortion will choose adoption. The vast majority will continue, just as in Roe and Casey’s time, to shoulder the costs of childrearing. Whether or not they choose to parent, they will experience the profound loss of autonomy and dignity that coerced pregnancy and birth always impose.
