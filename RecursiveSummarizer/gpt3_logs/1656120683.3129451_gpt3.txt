Write a detailed summary of the following:

the viability line established by Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey should be discarded under a stare decisis analysis. The Court held that the right to an abortion should extend far enough to ensure a reasonable opportunity to choose, but need not extend all the way to viability. In concurring with the Court's judgment, Chief Justice Roberts stated that the viability line never made any sense and that Mississippi's law allows a woman three months to obtain an abortion, well beyond the point at which it is considered "late" to discover a pregnancy.  The Supreme Court is set to hear a case that could potentially overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion nationwide. In Roe, the Court held that a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy extends up to the point that the fetus is considered viable outside the womb. However, the Court is now being asked to reconsider this rule in light of new scientific evidence that suggests a fetus may be viable earlier than previously thought. The case before the Court revolves around a challenged Louisiana law that requires abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. The Court is being asked to decide whether this law violates a woman's right to abortion as established in Roe. In his concurring opinion, Chief Justice Roberts makes clear that he does not believe the Court should overturn Roe at this time. He argues that the Court should exercise judicial restraint and refrain from making any sweeping changes to Roe, given that the law has been in place for nearly 50 years and has been reaffirmed by the Court on several occasions. Chief Justice Roberts also takes issue with the viability rule established in Roe, saying that it was "seriously erred" and was never adequately argued for in the first place. However, he ultimately concludes that it is not necessary to overturn Roe in order to rule on the Louisiana law before the Court.  In the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the Supreme Court was asked to consider the constitutionality of a Mississippi law that bans abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The Court ultimately struck down the law, but in doing so, Chief Justice Roberts offered a concurring opinion that called into question the long-standing precedent of Roe v. Wade. In Roe, the Court had established that abortions were constitutionally protected up until the point of viability, when a fetus could survive outside the womb. However, Roberts argued that this line is no longer tenable in light of subsequent decisions, such as Gonzales v. Carhart, which recognized a broader array of state interests in regulating abortion. Roberts also noted that the line is increasingly difficult to apply as medical technology advances. Ultimately, Roberts concluded that while the Mississippi law is unconstitutional, the Court should reconsider the viability standard set forth in Roe. This could have major implications for

The Supreme Court is set to hear a case that could potentially overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that legalized abortion nationwide. In Roe, the Court held that a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy extends up to the point that the fetus is considered viable outside the womb.
