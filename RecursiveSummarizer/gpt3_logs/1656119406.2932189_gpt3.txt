Write a detailed summary of the following:

“liberty” supporting the abortion right has shifted yet again. Respondents and the United States propose no fewer than three different interests that supposedly spring from the Due Process Clause. They include “bodily integrity,” “personal autonomy in matters of family, medical care, and faith,” Brief for Respondents 21, and “women’s equal citizenship,” Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24. That 50 years have passed since Roe and abortion advocates still cannot coherently articulate the right (or rights) at stake proves the obvious: The right to abortion is ultimately a policy goal in desperate search of a constitutional justification. Second, substantive due process distorts other areas of constitutional law. For example, once this Court identifies a “fundamental” right for one class of individuals, it invokes the Equal Protection Clause to demand exacting scrutiny of statutes that deny the right to others. See, e.g., Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438, 453–454 (1972) (relying on Griswold to invalidate a state statute prohibiting distribution   6 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION THOMAS, J., concurring of contraceptives to unmarried persons). Statutory classifications implicating certain “nonfundamental” rights, meanwhile, receive only cursory review. See, e.g., Armour v. Indianapolis, 566 U. S. 673, 680 (2012). Similarly, this Court deems unconstitutionally “vague” or “overbroad” those laws that impinge on its preferred rights, while letting slide those laws that implicate supposedly lesser values. See, e.g., Johnson, 576 U. S., at 618–621 (opinion of THOMAS, J.); United States v. Sineneng-Smith, 590 U. S. ___, ___–___ (2020) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3–5). “In fact, our vagueness doctrine served as the basis for the first draft of the majority opinion in Roe v. Wade,” and it since has been “deployed . . . to nullify even mild regulations of the abortion industry.” Johnson, 576 U. S., at 620–621 (opinion of THOMAS, J.). Therefore, regardless of the doctrinal context, the Court often “demand[s] extra justifications for encroachments” on “preferred rights” while “relax[ing] purportedly higher standards of review for lesspreferred rights.” Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt, 579 U. S. 582, 640–642 (2016) (THOMAS, J., dissenting). Substantive due process is the core inspiration for many of the Court’s constitutionally unmoored policy judgments. Third, substantive due process is often wielded to “disastrous ends.” Gamble, 587 U. S., at ___ (THOMAS, J., concurring) (slip op., at 16). For instance, in Dred Scott v. Sandford, 19 How. 393 (1857), the Court invoked a species of substantive due process to announce that Congress was powerless to emancipate slaves brought into the federal territories. See id., at 452. While Dred Scott “was overruled on the battlefields of the Civil War and by constitutional amendment after Appomattox,” Obergefell, 576 U. S., at 696 (ROBERTS, C. J., dissenting), that overruling was

RESPONSE:

The liberty supporting the abortion right has shifted yet again. Respondents and the United States propose three interests that supposedly spring from the Due Process Clause: bodily integrity, personal autonomy in matters of family, medical care, and faith, and women's equal citizenship. However, the fact that 50 years have passed since Roe and abortion advocates still cannot coherently articulate the right (or rights) at stake proves that the abortion is a policy goal in desperate search of a constitutional justification. Second, substantive due process distorts other areas of constitutional law. For example, once this Court identifies a "fundamental" right for one class of individuals, it invokes the Equal Protection Clause to demand exacting scrutiny of statutes that deny the right to others. Statutory classifications implicating certain "nonfundamental" rights, meanwhile, receive only cursory review. Similarly, this Court deems unconstitutionally "vague" or "overbroad" those laws that impinge on its preferred rights, while letting slide those laws that implicate supposedly lesser values. Third, substantive due process is often wielded to "disastrous ends." For instance, in Dred Scott v. Sandford, the Court invoked a species of substantive due process to announce that Congress was powerless to emancipate slaves brought into the federal territories. While Dred Scott was overruled by the Civil War and by constitutional amendment, that overruling was not the end of the Court's use of substantive due process to achieve policy goals. The Court has continued to use substantive due process to strike down laws regulating abortion, contraception, and other areas of personal autonomy. This use of substantive due process has led to "disastrous ends" and has distorted other areas of constitutional law.
