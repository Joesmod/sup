the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives. Ibid. The contending sides in this case make impassioned and conflicting arguments about the effects of the abortion right on the lives of women as well as the status of the fetus. The Casey pluralitys speculative attempt to weigh the relative importance of the interests of the fetus and the mother represent a departure from the original constitutional proposition that courts do not substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies. Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U. S. 726, 729730. The Solicitor General suggests that overruling Roe and Casey would threaten the protection of other rights under the Due Process Clause. The Court emphasizes that this decision concerns the constitutional right to abortion and no other right. Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion. Pp. 6366. (c) Casey identified another concern, namely, the danger that the public will perceive a decision overruling a controversial watershed decision, such as Roe, as influenced by political considerations or public opinion. 505 U. S., at 866867. But the Court cannot allow its decisions to be affected by such extraneous concerns. A precedent of this Court is subject to the usual principles of stare decisis under which adherence to precedent is the norm but not an inexorable command. If the rule were otherwise, erroneous decisions like Plessy would still be the law. The Courts job is to interpret the law, apply longstanding principles of stare decisis, and decide this case accordingly. Pp. 6669. (d) Under the Courts precedents, rational-basis review is the appropriate standard to apply when state abortion regulations undergo constitutional challenge. Given that procuring an abortion is not a fundamental constitutional right, it follows that the States may regulate abortion for legitimate reasons, and when such regulations are challenged under the Constitution, courts cannot substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies. Ferguson, 372 U. S., at 729730. That applies even when the laws at issue concern matters of great social significance and moral substance. A law regulating abortion, like other health and welfare laws, is entitled to a    8 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Syllabus strong presumption of validity. Heller v. Doe, 509 U. S. 312, 319. It must be sustained if there is a rational basis on which the legislature could have thought that it would serve legitimate state interests. Id., at 320. Mississippis Gestational Age Act is supported by the Mississippi Legislatures specific findings, which include the States asserted interest in protecting the life of the unborn. 2(b)(i). These legitimate interests provide a rational basis for the Gestational Age Act, and it follows that respondents constitutional challenge must fail. Pp. 76 78.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

The Supreme Court has ruled that states can regulate abortion for legitimate reasons, and that such regulations are entitled to a strong presumption of validity. In this case, the Court upheld a Mississippi law regulating abortion based on the state's interest in protecting the life of the unborn.
