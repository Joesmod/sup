In that way, the constitutional values of liberty and equality go hand in hand; they do not inhabit the hermetically sealed containers the majority portrays. Compare Obergefell, 576 U. S., at 672675, with ante, at 1011. So before Roe and Casey, the Court expanded in successive cases those who could claim the right to marrythough their relationships would have been outside the laws protection in the mid19th century. See, e.g., Loving, 388 U. S. 1 (interracial couples); Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78 (1987) (prisoners); see also, e.g., Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U. S. 645, 651652 (1972) (offering constitutional protection to untraditional family unit[s]). And after Roe and Casey, of course, the Court continued in that vein. With a critical stop to hold that the Fourteenth Amendment protected same-sex intimacy, the Court resolved that the Amendment also conferred on same-sex couples the right to marry. See Lawrence, 539 U. S. 558; Obergefell, 576 U. S. 644.

The Court then understood, as the majority today does not, that the men who ratified the Fourteenth Amendment and wrote the state laws of the time did not view women as full and equal citizens. See supra, at 15. A woman then, Casey wrote, had no legal existence separate from her husband. 505 U. S., at 897. Women were seen only as the center of home and family life, without full and independent legal status under the Constitution. Ibid. But that could not be true any longer: The State could not now insist on the historically dominant vision of the womans role. Id., at 852.

For much that reason, Casey made clear that the precedents Roe most closely tracked were those involving

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Court has a history of expanding the sphere of protected liberty to groups that were previously excluded. In Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Court extended constitutional protection to women's reproductive rights. The Court has continued in this vein, most recently with Obergefell v. Hodges, which extended the right to marry to same-sex couples. The majority in the present case fails to recognize that the sentiments of 1868 alone do not and cannot rule the present.
