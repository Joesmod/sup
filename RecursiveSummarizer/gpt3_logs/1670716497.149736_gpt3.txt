income individuals, and Section 3 businesses.  Contractors must ensure that 25% of total labor hours are completed by low-income workers and 5% of which are completed by CHA residents.  Additionally, CHA is exceeding HUD's rules by keeping our existing requirement that contractors and developers must subcontract at least 10% of the contract value to Section 3 businesses.

There have also been changes to how we manage the Section 3 pool, which were made to provide closer tracking and
