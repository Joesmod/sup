Write a detailed summary of the following:

Supreme Court of the United States issued its long-awaited ruling on the constitutionality of abortion regulation in the case of June Medical Services LLC v. Russo. In a 5-4 decision, the Court struck down a Louisiana law requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital, finding that the law placed an undue burden on women seeking abortions. The majority opinion, written by Justice Stephen Breyer, was joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. Chief Justice John Roberts filed a concurring opinion. Justice Clarence Thomas filed a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch. In his majority opinion, Justice Breyer began by reviewing the history of abortion regulation in the United States, starting with the Roe v. Wade decision in 1973. He noted that the Roe decision had been increasingly criticized in recent years, with some calling for it to be overturned. Breyer then turned to the specific Louisiana law at issue in the case. He found that the law would have closed two of the state's three abortion clinics, and would have left only one clinic open that could serve the entire state. This would have placed an undue burden on women seeking abortions, in violation of the Supreme Court's previous rulings. In his concurring opinion, Chief Justice Roberts wrote that he did not agree with the reasoning of the majority opinion, but nonetheless concurred in the judgment striking down the Louisiana law. He stated that the Court's precedent in Planned Parenthood v. Casey required him to reach this conclusion. In his dissenting opinion, Justice Thomas argued that the Supreme Court should have overturned the Roe decision. He criticized the majority opinion for its reliance on the Casey decision, which he argued was wrongly decided. Thomas also argued that the Louisiana law at issue in the case did not impose an undue burden on women seeking abortions.  In 1992, the Supreme Court issued its Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision, which significantly altered the legal landscape surrounding abortion. Prior to Casey, the Court's decision in Roe v. Wade had established a nationwide right to abortion, and had set up a three-tiered system whereby states could only regulate abortion in certain ways during specific periods of pregnancy. In Casey, however, the Court rejected Roe's trimester scheme and instead adopted a new and less clear "undue burden" test. Since its inception, Casey's "undue burden" test has proven to be difficult to apply in a consistent and predictable manner. This has led to a number of Circuit conflicts, as well as to the distortion of many important but unrelated legal doctrines. Moreover, Casey's recognition of a more intangible form of reliance on abortion has made it even more difficult to overturn. Despite these challenges, there are several good reasons to overturn Casey and return to the pre-Casey legal landscape. First, Casey's "undue burden" test
