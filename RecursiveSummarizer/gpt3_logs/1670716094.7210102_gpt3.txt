PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


the Department of Environment wasn't the best moving, you know, bifurcating all of those responsibilities, and I think bringing these things back together.  Now with this department or this, this office have enforcement authority.  Right now this office is more on the policy and planning side the enforcement authority believes sits with Department of Public Health, Health and Buildings.  Okay.  And so that's the step one, and then step two is to bring the enforcement aspect.  And that's what we're going to look at over this next year is really look at all the different roles, kind of who owns that now, and then what that looks like either coming back or, or staying or, but that's part of the discussion that's going to happen over the next year.  Okay.  All right, very well.  I know that we also discussed the.  We talked about the Department of Environment, the streets and sanitation, also our task force order is related to overall sanitation collection.  Where, where we on that particular front.  I'm sorry Mr.  I'm sorry, I'll demand I missed your last part of your question.  Is in relation to more review of the collection efforts today versus where they been we've got a nice body of information now to, to talk to that and just trying to make those comparisons between a point one and point two.  This is around garbage or based.  Yes, yes.  So we have taken a look at that.  We're happy to definitely have more conversation around that about what the costs what would be to go back to word based versus what it is today.  And it is, it is a high dollar amount that we've pulled together.  Well, I you know I'm a believer that we don't necessarily have to have need necessarily need more resources to make that work but work within the confines of what we have to see, you know, if it is possible.  And I think that's part of the exercise that we may need to entail so again, thank you for your information back to us on on these things.  I may have another question I got to look


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Department of Environment is in the process of bifurcating all of its responsibilities, and this may have negative consequences for enforcement of environmental policy. The Department of Public Health is currently responsible for enforcement of environmental policy, but this may change in the future. The task force related to overall sanitation collection is currently reviewing the garbage collection efforts to see if they can be improved.
