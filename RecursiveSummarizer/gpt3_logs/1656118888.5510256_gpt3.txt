RESPONSE:

In Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court found that a woman's right to obtain an abortion is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. However, this right was not established when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted. Instead, it was only established in the latter part of the 20th century. Prior to Roe, there was an unbroken tradition of prohibiting abortion on pain of criminal punishment. This tradition persisted from the earliest days of the common law until 1973. The vast majority of states criminalized abortion at all stages of pregnancy by 1868. Respondents and their amici have no persuasive answer to this historical evidence. They are unable to show that a constitutional right to abortion was established when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted. Instead, they are forced to argue that it "does not matter" that some states prohibited abortion at the time Roe was decided. But this argument flies in the face of the standard the Supreme Court has applied in determining whether an asserted right that is nowhere mentioned in the Constitution is nevertheless protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. The earliest sources called to the Court's attention are a few district court and state court decisions decided shortly before Roe, and a small number of law review articles from the same time period. A few of respondents' amici muster historical arguments, but they are very weak. The Solicitor General repeats Roe's claim that it is "doubtful" that abortion was ever firmly established as a common-law crime. But as the Court has seen, great common-law authorities like Bracton, Coke, Hale, and Blackstone all wrote that a post-quickening abortion was a crime. Moreover, Hale and Blackstone (and many other authorities following them) asserted that even a pre-quickening abortion was "unlawful" and that, as a result, an abortionist was guilty of murder if the woman died from the attempt. Instead of following these authorities, Roe relied largely on two articles by a pro-abortion advocate who claimed that Coke had intentionally misstated the common law because of his strong anti-abortion views. These articles have been roundly criticized by historians. And even if they were accurate, they would only show that the common law was unsettled at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment. They would not show that a right to abortion was established by that Amendment. In sum, the historical evidence shows that there was no constitutional right to abortion established when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted. And since Roe, there has been no effort to amend the Constitution to establish such a right. The only way to overturn Roe, therefore, is to convince the Supreme Court to overturn its precedent.
