Write a concise summary of the following:

4141191(2)(b)(i)(8). That procedure accounts for most abortions performed after the first trimestertwo weeks before the period at issue in this caseand involve[s] the use of surgical instruments to crush and tear the unborn child apart. Ibid.; see also Gonzales, 550 U. S., at 135. Again, it would make little sense to focus on viability when evaluating a law based on these permissible goals. In short, the viability rule was created outside the ordinary course of litigation, is and always has been completely unreasoned, and fails to take account of state interests since recognized as legitimate. It is indeed telling that other countries almost uniformly eschew a viability line. Ante, at 53 (opinion of the Court). Only a handful of countries, among them China and North Korea, permit elective abortions after twenty weeks; the rest have coalesced around a 12week line. See The Worlds Abortion Laws, Center for Reproductive Rights (Feb. 23, 2021) (online source archived at www.supremecourt.gov) (Canada, China, Iceland, Guinea-Bissau, the Netherlands, North Korea, Singapore, and Vietnam permit elective abortions after twenty weeks). The Court rightly rejects the arbitrary viability rule today. II None of this, however, requires that we also take the dramatic step of altogether eliminating the abortion right first recognized in Roe. Mississippi itself previously argued as much to this Court in this litigation. When the State petitioned for our review, its basic request was straightforward: clarify whether abortion prohibitions before viability are always unconstitutional. Pet. for Cert. 14. The State made a number of strong arguments that the answer is no, id., at 1526arguments that, as discussed, I find persuasive. And it went out of its way to make clear that it was not asking the Court to repudiate   6 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment entirely the right to choose whether to terminate a pregnancy: To be clear, the questions presented in this petition do not require the Court to overturn Roe or Casey. Id., at 5. Mississippi tempered that statement with an oblique one-sentence footnote intimating that, if the Court could not reconcile Roe and Casey with current facts or other cases, it should not retain erroneous precedent. Pet. for Cert. 56, n. 1. But the State never argued that we should grant review for that purpose. After we granted certiorari, however, Mississippi changed course. In its principal brief, the State bluntly announced that the Court should overrule Roe and Casey. The Constitution does not protect a right to an abortion, it argued, and a State should be able to prohibit elective abortions if a rational basis supports doing so. See Brief for Petitioners 1213. The Court now rewards that gambit, noting three times that the parties presented no half-measures and argued that we must either reaffirm or overrule Roe and Casey. Ante, at 5, 8, 72. Given those two options,

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution does not protect a right to an abortion, and that states may prohibit elective abortions if a rational basis supports doing so. This ruling overturns the previous precedent set by Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood.
