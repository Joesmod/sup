as you know the question around enforcement the question around, you know, different pieces.  You know between a is, you know, CDP H seed out every, there's a lot of pieces and we want to also thoughtfully look at all the roles and responsibilities, and then get to the right ordinance at the end of the day, you know, looking at who has to do what so I think it's all important to start and I'm sure you know as that rolls forward on that there may be other things that we will look at, and I'm, I'm, I'm assuming, let me, let me.  I'm just going to talk about you know, with all the respect, Madam Chair, one to 100 I think you know we need to get that we need to get there quicker.  How will this study be funded and you need to get there quickly in, in the right order right.  We want to be there quick and right.  Well, I heard about that promise four years ago so we could have done that so at any rate, who will be conducting a study, how will it be funded.  On the study.  We are in the process of designing the scope and talking to CCA about pro bono consulting to help support the study, and I will also add that the study will be done with a robust stakeholder process, both to engage people that serve within the city now to think about their existing roles, and where those roles might be combined, working with stakeholders across the city and of course with leadership, like folks in this room to identify the best governance structure possible.  So that's the goal of the study, you know, and that's interesting because my first thought is six months to do a study I was like, this is going to procurement forget about that.  So it sounds like it's going to be a pro bono study through CCA is what I'm hearing.  What's the accountability.  Then if there's no contract that there's no procurement process with the sense to get that done in six months.  It is my understanding that it through this language and please Susie or a verify this that we will be taking the recommendations
