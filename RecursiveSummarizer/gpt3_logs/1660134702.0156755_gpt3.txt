RESPONSE:

This section of the bill deals with the payment amount for Part B rebatable drugs. The payment amount for a calendar quarter is the lesser of the drug's price for that quarter or the inflation-adjusted payment amount determined under paragraph (3)(C) for such Part B rebatable drug. If the payment amount for a calendar quarter exceeds the inflation-adjusted payment for such quarter, the coinsurance for such calendar quarter is equal to 20 percent of the inflation-adjusted payment amount determined under paragraph (3)(C) for such Part B rebatable drug. Amounts paid as rebates under paragraph (1)(B) are to be deposited into the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund established under section 1841.
