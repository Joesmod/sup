Write a concise summary of the following:


for.  Whether or not we give credits for those who maintain adjacent lots.  I know that's been a question, particularly from residents, not just businesses or churches or organizations but residents who oftentimes maintain vacant lots, and then are asked to pay full price for them as well on their block so I definitely support us looking into that.  I think this all the little piss could you repeat the last part of the process.  I'm sure to the point that all the men doll brought up this church provides services to the community just like the last purchaser did.  And this just raises a lot of questions for us when we are may not be showing favoritism to a church for the constitution, but in this instance it does appear the appearance of favoritism to a not for profit over a religious institution seems glaringly obvious so I think we need to correct that.  Thank you chairman.  Thank you.  Any other questions on this.  See none can I get a motion to recommend approval of this item by the affirmative vote of all members present to term for roll call.  So move, Alderman Kaplan then.  Alderman Kaplan so moves hearing no objections chairman please mark me down as no.  Here no objection so order do pass recommendation of this ordinance report at the next city council meeting.  December 14 2022 with the understanding element Lopez is a no Alderman doll I think if you would like to have a further conversation, and Nelson if you can talk to the commissioner about the specific issues that were raised on this item today.  I would appreciate it I think what I think the members of the committee are asking for is more transparency, kind of how it goes, moving forward, so I think that.  And just a real quick question for the next item is the issue, the issues of the negotiation on the sales are those done by the planners and the respective geographic areas.  Or is that kind of funneled up to you and others.  They selected me right it is is a collaborative decision between that


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The issue of whether or not to give credits to those who maintain adjacent lots is being discussed. It is known that residents who maintain vacant lots are often asked to pay full price for them, and it is hoped that this will be looked into further. There is also discussion of a church that has been given favoritism in the form of a discount on a lot purchase, and it is hoped that this will be corrected. Finally, the process for negotiating sales is clarified as being a collaborative decision between planners and others.
