See Brief for 547 Deans 9–10. We do not say that every State is Mississippi, and we are sure some have made gains since Roe and Casey in providing support for women and children. But a state-by-state analysis by public health professionals shows that States with the most restrictive abortion policies also continue to invest the least in women’s and children’s health. See Brief for 547 Deans 23–34. The only notable change we can see since Roe and Casey cuts in favor of adhering to precedent: It is that American abortion law has become more and more aligned with other nations. The majority, like the Mississippi Legislature, claims that the United States is an extreme outlier when it comes to abortion regulation. See ante, at 6, and n. 15. The global trend, however, has been toward increased provision of legal and safe abortion care. A number of countries, including New Zealand, the Netherlands, and Iceland, permit abortions up to a roughly similar time as Roe and Casey set.

DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Mississippi Legislature passed a law that bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with no exceptions for rape, incest, or health of the mother. The law was challenged, and the Supreme Court upheld it. Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., dissenting. The majority opinion is wrong for several reasons. First, it flies in the face of 40 years of Supreme Court precedent holding that abortion is a constitutional right. Second, it is based on a misreading of Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Third, it ignores the reality that states with the most restrictive abortion laws also have some of the highest rates of maternal mortality and morbidity. Fourth, and most importantly, the decision will hurt women's health. Mississippi has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the country, and this law will only make it worse. Fifth, the decision is out of step with the global trend toward increased access to safe and legal abortion. In conclusion, the dissenters would reverse the lower court's decision and strike down the Mississippi law.
