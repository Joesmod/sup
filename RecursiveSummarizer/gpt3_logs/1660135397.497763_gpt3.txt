RESPONSE:

This passage explains how to determine if a product has been manufactured in the United States. If the construction of the facility where the product was made begins before January 1, 2025, then 40 percent of the total costs of all manufactured products of that facility must be attributable to products mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States. If the construction of the facility where the product was made begins after December 31, 2024 and before January 1, 2026, then 45 percent of the total costs of all manufactured products of that facility must be attributable to products mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States. If the construction of the facility where the product was made begins after December 31, 2025 and before January 1, 2027, then 50 percent of the total costs of all manufactured products of that facility must be attributable to products mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States. If the construction of the facility where the product was made begins after December 31, 2026, then 55 percent of the total costs of all manufactured products of that facility must be attributable to products mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States.
