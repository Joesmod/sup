supports, and that's the bricks and mortar piece.  In addition, we've built all kinds of additional outreach to the people who are not stable enough to really come into attending an appointment on a Tuesday.  So I really want to emphasize that this council has given us the funding and supported us growing a real safety net system in the city of Chicago and I'd refer you to mental health that Chicago.  If you want to see the details of that but there will there is a site in every one there will be by the end of the year, every one of our 77 communities, and we've more than doubled the CD pH staff working on mental health since 2019.  Thank you, Alderman Seechel Lopez, Alderman capital man.  Madam Chair.  Good morning.  I think, no, good afternoon.  I'm going to start with a few life with dates that are just stick out in our minds for me it's April 22 1970 was a very first Earth Day, it changed my whole outlook.  I'm also not from Chicago I'm from outside Houston and the home I grew up in.  It was destroyed.  Actually my whole neighborhood was destroyed it's now a swamp.  Because the land sunk from a series of hurricanes and because of Exxon pumping water out from underneath the land so I get it, I'm an environmentalist I've been composting for 20 years, actually I grew up composting so it's just a part of my life.  I'm not going to say all that because this office environment is very very the department environment is very very important to me, but I also sense from from speaking with you all that's very important to you as well.  So, it appears that we're all very anxious to do some actions that will help save our planet.  How do you see having a pilot or a study whatever this next process.  How is that going to slow down or speed up our efforts in our quest to make this planet better.  Yeah.  Thank you for the question and I'm really excited to answer this because I would also like to provide the opportunity to talk about the exciting things that we are doing on
