RESPONSE:

The annual deductible for covered drugs under Medicare Part D is $415 in 2020. The term "applicable drug" means a covered Part D drug that is approved by the FDA and is on the formulary of the prescription drug plan or Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug (MAPD) plan that the applicable beneficiary is enrolled in. The term "applicable number of calendar days" means 14 days for electronically submitted claims and 30 days for other claims. The "discounted price" is the price of a covered drug after the annual deductible has been met.
