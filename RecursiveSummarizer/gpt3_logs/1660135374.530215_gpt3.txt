CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The "Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction for New and Existing Power Plants" rule, issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2015, requires power plants to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by a certain percentage below a baseline emissions rate. The rule applies to new, modified, and existing power plants and sets different targets for each category. For new power plants, the target is a greenhouse gas emission rate that is no more than 1,000 pounds of CO2e per megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity produced. For existing coal-fired power plants, the target is a reduction of at least 32 percent below the baseline emissions rate. The rule also requires power plants to meet an interim emissions reduction target of 30 percent below the baseline by 2030.
