Write a concise summary of the following:

upheld a Mississippi law regulating abortion based on the state's interest in protecting the life of the unborn.  The Supreme Court has overturned a lower court ruling that had struck down a Mississippi law banning most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The Court ruled that the Constitution does not protect a woman's right to an abortion, and that each state is free to regulate or prohibit abortion as it sees fit.  The Roe v. Wade decision sparked a national controversy that has embittered our political culture for a half century. In the years since Roe, the issue of abortion has continued to be a highly divisive issue in the United States. In the 1992 case of Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, the Supreme Court revisited Roe, but the Court was split three ways on the issue. The three justices who signed the controlling opinion in Casey concluded that stare decisis, which calls for prior decisions to be followed in most instances, required adherence to what it called Roes central holdingthat a State may not constitutionally protect fetal life before viabilityeven if that holding was wrong.  The question before the Court is whether to overturn Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood, which established a woman's right to have an abortion. The State of Mississippi has passed a law prohibiting abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The respondents and the Solicitor General argue that the Mississippi law cannot stand if Roe and Casey are not overturned. The Court will consider whether to overturn Roe and Casey and allow the State of Mississippi to prohibit abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy.  The law in question, Mississippis Gestational Age Act, contains a provision stating that an abortion may not be performed on an unborn human being if the probable gestational age of the unborn human being has been determined to be greater than fifteen weeks.  The Gestational Age Act was enacted in Mississippi to outlaw abortions after 20 weeks of gestation. The legislature made a series of factual findings to support the Act, including that at the time of enactment, only six countries besides the United States permit[ted] nontherapeutic or elective abortion-on-demand after the twentieth week of gestation. The Act was immediately challenged in court by an abortion clinic and one of its doctors, who claimed that it violated this Court's precedents establishing a constitutional right to abortion. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the respondents and permanently enjoined enforcement of the Act.  The Court will hear a case on whether pre-viability prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional. The Mississippi Gestational Age Act is being challenged, which bans abortions after 15 weeks of gestation. Petitioners argue that the Act is constitutional because it satisfies rational-basis review. Respondents argue that allowing Mississippi to ban pre-viability abortions would be no different than overruling Casey and
