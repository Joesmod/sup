This section of the bill establishes the payment amount for Part B rebatable drugs for each calendar quarter.

The Secretary may reduce or waive the amount under subparagraph (A) with respect to a part B rebatable drug and a calendar quarter in the case of a part B rebatable drug that is described as currently in shortage on the shortage list in
