Write a concise summary of the following:

896, 898. So how is it that, as Casey said, our Constitution, read  16 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting now, grants rights to women, though it did not in 1868? How is it that our Constitution subjects discrimination against them to heightened judicial scrutiny? How is it that our Constitution, through the Fourteenth Amendments liberty clause, guarantees access to contraception (also not legally protected in 1868) so that women can decide for themselves whether and when to bear a child? How is it that until today, that same constitutional clause protected a womans right, in the event contraception failed, to end a pregnancy in its earlier stages? The answer is that this Court has rejected the majoritys pinched view of how to read our Constitution. The Founders, we recently wrote, knew they were writing a document designed to apply to ever-changing circumstances over centuries. NLRB v. Noel Canning, 573 U. S. 513, 533534 (2014). Or in the words of the great Chief Justice John Marshall, our Constitution is intended to endure for ages to come, and must adapt itself to a future seen dimly, if at all. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 415 (1819). That is indeed why our Constitution is written as it is. The Framers (both in 1788 and 1868) understood that the world changes. So they did not define rights by reference to the specific practices existing at the time. Instead, the Framers defined rights in general terms, to permit future evolution in their scope and meaning. And over the course of our history, this Court has taken up the Framers invitation. It has kept true to the Framers principles by applying them in new ways, responsive to new societal understandings and conditions. Nowhere has that approach been more prevalent than in construing the majestic but open-ended words of the Fourteenth Amendmentthe guarantees of liberty and equality for all. And nowhere has that approach produced prouder moments, for this country and the Court. Consider an example Obergefell used a few years ago. The Court Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 17 BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting there confronted a claim, based on Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U. S. 702 (1997), that the Fourteenth Amendment must be defined in a most circumscribed manner, with central reference to specific historical practicesexactly the view todays majority follows. Obergefell, 576 U. S., at 671. And the Court specifically rejected that view.4 In doing so, the Court reflected on what the proposed, historically circumscribed approach would have meant for interracial marriage. See ibid. The Fourteenth Amendments ratifiers did not think it gave black and white people a right to marry each other. To the contrary, contemporaneous practice deemed that act quite as unprotected as abortion. Yet the Court in Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967), read the Fourteenth Amendment to embrace the Lovings union. If,

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The U.S. Constitution is written in such a way that it can adapt to changing circumstances over time. This has allowed the Constitution to protect women's rights, even though it did not do so in 1868. The Constitution subjects discrimination against women to heightened judicial scrutiny and guarantees access to contraception. The Founders knew that the world would change over time, so they wrote the Constitution in general terms, rather than defining rights by reference to specific practices of the time.
