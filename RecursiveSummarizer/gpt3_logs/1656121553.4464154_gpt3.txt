weeks. Miss. Code Ann. 4141191(4)(b). The Mississippi Legislatures findings recount the stages of human prenatal development and assert the States interest in protecting the life of the unborn. 2(b)(i). The legislature also found that abortions performed after 15 weeks typically use the dilation and evacuation procedure, and the legislature found the use of this procedure for nontherapeutic or elective reasons [to be] a barbaric practice, dangerous for the maternal patient, and demeaning to the medical profession. 2(b)(i)(8); see also Gonzales, 550 U. S., at 135143 (describing such procedures). These legitimate interests provide a rational basis for the Gestational Age Act, and it follows that respondents constitutional challenge must fail.
