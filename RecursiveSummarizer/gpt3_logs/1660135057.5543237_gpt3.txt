CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

This section of the Clean Air Act defines "lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions" and requires that they be measured using the GREET model. It also defines "qualified clean hydrogen" as hydrogen produced with a lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions rate of no more than 4 kilograms of CO2e per kilogram of hydrogen.
