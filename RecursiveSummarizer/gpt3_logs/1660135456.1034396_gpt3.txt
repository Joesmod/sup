CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

This section establishes the emissions rates for transportation fuels, expressed in terms of kilograms of CO2e per mmBTU. The rates are to be based on the most recent determinations under the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation model developed by Argonne National Laboratory, or a successor model. For aviation fuels, the rates are to be based on the most recent Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization with the agreement of the United States, or a similar methodology. The rates may be rounded to the nearest multiple of 5 kilograms of CO2e per mmBTU, except in the case of an emissions rate that is between 2.5 and -2.5 kilograms of CO2e per mmBTU, which may be rounded to zero.
