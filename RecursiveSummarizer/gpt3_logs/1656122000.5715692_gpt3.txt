functions), Illinois v. Gates (the Fourth Amendment requires a totality of the circumstances approach for determining whether an informants tip establishes probable cause), and United States v. Scott (the Double Jeopardy Clause does not apply to Government appeals from orders granting defense motions to terminate a trial before verdict).  The U.S. Supreme Court should overrule the Roe and Casey decisions because they are egregiously wrong and deeply damaging. They are in conflict with the Constitution and have had a disruptive effect on other areas of the law.  The Court in Roe v. Wade wrongly removed the issue of abortion from the democratic process by finding a constitutional right to obtain an abortion. This decision was based on weak reasoning and should be reconsidered.  In Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court held that states cannot protect fetal life prior to viability. This rule was never raised by any party and has never been plausibly explained. The Court's reasoning quickly drew scathing scholarly criticism.  The Court's opinion in Roe v. Wade featured a lengthy survey of history, but much of its discussion was irrelevant, and the Court made no effort to explain why it was included. For example, multiple paragraphs were devoted to an account of the views and practices of ancient civilizations where infanticide was widely accepted. See 410 U. S., at 130132 (discussing ancient Greek and Roman practices).49 When it came to the most important historical facthow the States regulated abortion when the Fourteenth Amendment was adoptedthe Court said almost nothing. It allowed that States had tightened their abortion laws in the middle and late 19th century, id., at 139, but it implied that these laws might have been enacted not to protect fetal life but to further a Victorian social concern about illicit sexual conduct, id., at 148. Roe's failure even to note the overwhelming consensus of state laws in effect in 1868 is striking, and what it said about the common law was simply wrong. Relying on two discredited articles by an abortion advocate, the Court erroneously suggestedcontrary to Bracton, Coke, Hale, Blackstone, and a wealth of other authoritythat the common law had probably never really treated post-quickening abortion as a crime. See id., at 136 ([I]t now appear[s] doubtful that abortion was ever firmly established as a common-law crime even with respect to the destruction of a quick fetus). This erroneous understanding appears to have played an important part in the Court's thinking because the opinion cited the lenity of the common law as one of the four factors that informed its decision. Id., at 165. After surveying history, the opinion spent many paragraphs conducting the sort of fact-finding that might be undertaken by a legislative committee. This included a lengthy account of the position of the American Medical Association and [t]he position of the American Public Health Association, as well as the vote by the American Bar

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The U.S. Supreme Court should overrule the Roe and Casey decisions because they are in conflict with the Constitution and have had a disruptive effect on other areas of the law. Roe v. Wade removed the issue of abortion from the democratic process by finding a constitutional right to obtain an abortion, and the Court's reasoning in Roe has been heavily criticized. The Court should reconsider its decision in Roe in light of the overwhelming consensus of state laws in effect in 1868 that protected fetal life.
