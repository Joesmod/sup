more costly to the taxpayer.  My question is, what is the plan to look into the public, you know, public facilities to make sure that we use funds and what are those funds I mean is there any plan I know we heard here about using funds to repurpose facilities, or we, you know, creating private public partnerships that ended up with more costly to the taxpayer.  What is the goal or what is the vision of the administration.  I can't speak for the AIS Commissioner, but I think if your question is around funding for our public facilities.  We do have funding for, you know, upgrading and improving our, our facilities and that is part of our continuous cycle of you know improvements maintenance of our city facilities.  So that money is is budgeted in the capital plan.  And just to the social programming of it I know that we, we have a lot of agencies, you know, we have CPS.  I am just really concerned about the level of coordination that we have, especially when it comes to young people.  What is the response that maybe we have CD pH here, we have a national crisis in terms of youth, especially youth mental health.  What is the allocation or the proper allocation to address these I think I'm really concerned about the level of violence that is affecting young people, how we created more activities more spaces more infrastructure but as well as more programming, how we're doing these in between agencies, excuse me, Alderman we're not revisiting the budget hearings again.  That was, you know, the Department of Public Health was here.  And I think that was a opportunity to ask coordination questions then.  So if you have a question on any of the amendments managed, which is, which is not part CPS and the park district, CTA and not part of this amendment here.  I would ask that you go to your next question.  Yeah, my next question then very clear right, I think that when it comes to looking at our facilities and all that the mental health is a huge issue.  How do we repurpose
