RESPONSE:

The conversation is about whether or not the government can protect speech that is objectionable. Ms. Waggoner argues that if the objection is contained in the message, it is protected speech and the government can't do anything about it. Justice Sotomayor argues that if the message is identical but from a disabled couple, it should still be protected speech. Ms. Waggoner argues that what matters is the objection to the message, not the identity of the speaker.
