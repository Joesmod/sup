PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


you, Madam Chairman.  Thank you, all the men asked him and all the men King.  Thank you, Madam Chair, I would just want to echo all the men asked him and word about uplifting the Department of Environment.  You know, I, we're sitting in the middle of the Great Lakes, we've got water the west coast doesn't have water.  East Coast has hurricanes, I just think, you know, adding a department clarifies our priority there so I just want to uplift that I don't want to belabor that.  How about an office of gun violence prevention.  Do we have money in the budget for that.  There's no office set aside but I know we've talked a lot about, you know, with all the departments coming in all, you know, the all hands on deck approach and you know all the pieces that all the departments have around violence prevention.  But there's no specific office if that's what you're asking.  And I think that again, kind of echoes our, or speaks to our priorities just like we don't have a Department of Environment, we need a Department of gun violence prevention if that's, you know, one of our biggest priorities and I would say, you know, giving all the mass shootings and everything that that would be one.  So, how much money is distributed and kind of where is it.  And if you can get that through the chair for gun violence prevention.  Do you have that number, not with me, but we could definitely provide that.  How many people in different offices are working on this effort around.  Well so around violence prevention, you know, I can say as a department in the city that it's it's everyone's, everyone is working on that.  And so when you, why, why don't we have an office where somebody is leading that effort and responsibility, or department.  What I will say is you know around violence prevention you know we work with CDP H, a lot of the funding sits under the public health department we have now the CSCC who is helping to coordinate all the different pieces as well across the departments,
