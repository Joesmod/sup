to same-sex couples and to recognize same-sex marriages that were lawfully licensed and performed out-of-state. The Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment does indeed require states to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and to recognize same-sex marriages that were lawfully licensed and performed out-of-state. In reaching this conclusion, the Court first explained that the right to marry is a fundamental right that is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court then explained that the Fourteenth Amendment does not freeze the original understanding of what rights are guaranteed or how they apply; instead, the Amendment allows for the evolution of these rights over time. The Court next turned to the question of whether same-sex couples should be allowed to marry. The Court explained that the right to marry is not just a fundamental right, but a right that has been recognized as fundamental throughout our history. The Court also explained that the right to marry is a fundamental right that is essential to the order and stability of society. Finally, the Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment requires states to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and to recognize same-sex marriages that were lawfully licensed and performed out-of-state. In so holding, the Court explained that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees equality for all, regardless of sexual orientation.  The majority opinion in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization case held that the "specific practice" of abortion is not protected by the Fourteenth Amendment's substantive sphere of liberty. In doing so, the majority overruled the precedent set by Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood. The majority's opinion is based on the premise that the Fourteenth Amendment was not intended to protect abortion when it was ratified in 1868. The majority argues that because abortion was not a "specific practice" protected by the Amendment at the time, it cannot be protected now. The dissent argues that this interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment is contrary to decades of precedent protecting a woman's right to choose. The dissent also points out that the majority's opinion will have far-reaching implications beyond the abortion context, potentially jeopardizing other areas of constitutional law that protect personal liberty.

In the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization case, the Supreme Court held that the "specific practice" of abortion is not protected by the Fourteenth Amendment's substantive sphere of liberty.

The Court's opinion is based on the premise that the Fourteenth Amendment was not intended to protect abortion when it was ratified in 1868. The Court argues that because abortion was not a "specific practice" protected by the Amendment at the time, it cannot be protected now. The dissent argues that this interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment is contrary to decades of precedent protecting a woman's right to choose. The dissent also points out that the Court's opinion will have far-reaching implications beyond the abortion context, potentially jeopardizing other areas of constitutional law that protect personal liberty. Justice Kavanaugh's argument that the Court is being "scrupulously neutral" by allowing states to decide whether to ban abortion is wrong. The Court is not being neutral when it eliminates a right that women have had for 50 years. The U.S. Supreme Court has acknowledged that every adult has a right to control what happens to their own body, including making decisions about medical procedures or treatments. This right has been affirmed in a number of cases, including Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood. In the Dobbs case, the Court overruled this precedent, holding that the Fourteenth Amendment does not protect the "specific practice" of abortion. This decision will have far-reaching implications beyond the abortion context, potentially jeopardizing other areas of constitutional law that protect personal liberty.
