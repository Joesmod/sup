Write a concise summary of the following:

then rejected a challenge to Missouris definition of viability, holding that the States definition was consistent with Roes. 428 U. S.,   74 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court at 6364. If viability was not an essential part of the rule adopted in Roe, the Court would have had no need to make that comparison. The holding in Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U. S. 379, is even more instructive. In that case, the Court noted that prior cases had stressed viability and reiterated that [v]iability is the critical point under Roe. 439 U. S., at 388389. It then struck down Pennsylvanias definition of viability, id., at 389394, and it is hard to see how the Court could have done that if Roes discussion of viability was not part of its holding. When the Court reconsidered Roe in Casey, it left no doubt about the importance of the viability rule. It described the rule as Roes central holding, 505 U. S., at 860, and repeatedly stated that the right it reaffirmed was the right of the woman to choose to have an abortion before viability. Id., at 846 (emphasis added). See id., at 871 (The womans right to terminate her pregnancy before viability is the most central principle of Roe v. Wade. It is a rule of law and a component of liberty we cannot renounce (emphasis added)); id., at 872 (A woman has a right to choose to terminate or continue her pregnancy before viability (emphasis added)); id., at 879 ([A] State may not prohibit any woman from making the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy before viability (emphasis added)). Our subsequent cases have continued to recognize the centrality of the viability rule. See Whole Womens Health, 579 U. S., at 589590 ([A] provision of law is constitutionally invalid, if the purpose or effect of the provision is to place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability (emphasis deleted and added)); id., at 627 ([W]e now use viability as the relevant point at which a State may begin limiting womens access to abortion for reasons unrelated to maternal health (emphasis added)).  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 75 Opinion of the Court Not only is the new rule proposed by the concurrence inconsistent with Caseys unambiguous language, post, at 8, it is also contrary to the judgment in that case and later abortion cases. In Casey, the Court held that Pennsylvanias spousal-notification provision was facially unconstitutional, not just that it was unconstitutional as applied to abortions sought prior to the time when a woman has had a reasonable opportunity to choose. See 505 U. S., at 887 898. The same is true of Whole Womens Health, which held that certain rules that required physicians performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital were facially unconstitutional because they placed a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking a previability abortion. 579 U. S., at 591

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Court has consistently held that the right to an abortion before viability is a central principle of Roe v. Wade, and that any state law that would place a substantial obstacle in the way of a woman seeking such an abortion is facially unconstitutional.
