discovered by six weeks of gestation). I see no sound basis for questioning the adequacy of that opportunity. But that is all I would say, out of adherence to a simple yet fundamental principle of judicial restraint: If it is not necessary to decide more to dispose of a case, then it is necessary not to decide more. Perhaps we are not always perfect in following that command, and certainly there are cases that warrant an exception. But this is not one of them. Surely we should adhere closely to principles of judicial restraint here, where the broader path the Court chooses entails repudiating a constitutional right we have not only previously recognized, but also expressly reaffirmed applying the doctrine of stare decisis. The Court’s opinion is thoughtful and thorough, but those virtues cannot compensate for the fact that its dramatic and consequential ruling is unnecessary to decide the case before us. I Let me begin with my agreement with the Court, on the only question we need decide here: whether to retain the rule from Roe and Casey that a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy extends up to the point that the fetus is regarded as “viable” outside the womb. I agree that this rule should be discarded. First, this Court seriously erred in Roe in adopting viability as the earliest point at which a State may legislate to advance its substantial interests in the area of abortion. See ante, at 50–53. Roe set forth a rigid three-part framework anchored to viability, which more closely resembled a regulatory code than a body of constitutional law. That  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 3 ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment framework, moreover, came out of thin air. Neither the Texas statute challenged in Roe nor the Georgia statute at issue in its companion case, Doe v. Bolton, 410 U. S. 179 (1973), included any gestational age limit. No party or amicus asked the Court to adopt a bright line viability rule. And as for Casey, arguments for or against the viability rule played only a de minimis role in the parties’ briefing and in the oral argument. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 17–18, 51 (fleeting discussion of the viability rule). It is thus hardly surprising that neither Roe nor Casey made a persuasive or even colorable argument for why the time for terminating a pregnancy must extend to viability. The Court’s jurisprudence on this issue is a textbook illustration of the perils of deciding a question neither presented nor briefed. As has been often noted, Roe’s defense of the line boiled down to the circular assertion that the State’s interest is compelling only when an unborn child can live outside the womb, because that is when the unborn child can live outside the womb.

DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court is set to hear a case that could potentially overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion nationwide. In Roe, the Court held that a woman's right to terminate her pregnancy extends up to the point that the fetus is considered viable outside the womb. However, the Court is now being asked to reconsider this rule in light of new scientific evidence that suggests a fetus may be viable earlier than previously thought. The case before the Court revolves around a challenged Louisiana law that requires abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. The Court is being asked to decide whether this law violates a woman's right to abortion as established in Roe. In his concurring opinion, Chief Justice Roberts makes clear that he does not believe the Court should overturn Roe at this time. He argues that the Court should exercise judicial restraint and refrain from making any sweeping changes to Roe, given that the law has been in place for nearly 50 years and has been reaffirmed by the Court on several occasions. Chief Justice Roberts also takes issue with the viability rule established in Roe, saying that it was "seriously erred" and was never adequately argued for in the first place. However, he ultimately concludes that it is not necessary to overturn Roe in order to rule on the Louisiana law before the Court.
