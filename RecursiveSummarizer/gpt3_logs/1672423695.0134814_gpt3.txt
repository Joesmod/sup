Ms.  Lane.  Hello, my name is Cheryl Nell Lane, and I'm a disabled resident in Chicago.  Every year we know that snow is coming, especially in Chicago.  I am a very active, well-traveled person with disabilities.  And during the winter months, my whole social life, work life activities are halted because of the snow.  There are more people than people with disabilities that need to travel the sidewalks, mothers with strollers, senior citizens, just normal ability residents.  We have black ice on our sidewalks, and sometimes we are forced to walk in the streets.  This is unacceptable.  We need to come together to put on the budget the funds needed to plow the sidewalks.

So we have to consider all residents of this city, all residents that need to get out.  And if you have a problem putting yourself in their shoes, think of it like this.  If there was an invisible force stopping you from leaving out of your front door to get to work, to get to this council meeting, to get to family gatherings for the holidays, what would you do then to make sure that you made the invisible force go away? This is how we have to consider the plow the sidewalks campaign, because if we don't plow the sidewalks, that's exactly what we're doing to a lot of residents in Chicago.  So please consider adding to the budget the funding needed for the pilot program to plow the sidewalks in Chicago.  Thank you.  Thank you very much, Ms.  Lane.  Our next speaker is Claire Falk.

And generally, I think Chicago is a great place to raise my kids, but I have a lot of pretty bad memories of when my two youngest kids were very small in the stroller.  There is times when I had imagined a newborn and a one-
