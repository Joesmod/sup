more than 20 Justices of this Court have now  12 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION KAVANAUGH, J., concurring grappled with the divisive issue of abortion. I greatly respect all of the Justices, past and present, who have done so. Amidst extraordinary controversy and challenges, all of them have addressed the abortion issue in good faith after careful deliberation, and based on their sincere understandings of the Constitution and of precedent. I have endeavored to do the same. In my judgment, on the issue of abortion, the Constitution is neither pro-life nor pro-choice. The Constitution is neutral, and this Court likewise must be scrupulously neutral. The Court today properly heeds the constitutional principle of judicial neutrality and returns the issue of abortion to the people and their elected representatives in the democratic process.

That question is directly implicated here: Mississippi’s Gestational Age Act, Miss. Code Ann. §41–41–191 (2018), generally prohibits abortion after the fifteenth week of pregnancy—several weeks before a fetus is regarded as “viable” outside the womb. In urging our review, Mississippi stated that its case was “an ideal vehicle” to “reconsider the bright-line viability rule,” and that a judgment in its favor would “not require the Court to overturn” Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833 (1992). Pet. for Cert. 5. Today, the Court nonetheless rules for Mississippi by doing just that. I would take a more measured course. I agree with the Court that the viability line established by Roe and Casey should be discarded under a straightforward stare decisis analysis. That line never made any sense. Our abortion precedents describe the right at issue as a woman’s right to choose to terminate her pregnancy. That right should therefore extend far enough to ensure a reasonable opportunity to choose, but need not extend any further— ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment   2 DOBBS v.

DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

In the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the Supreme Court ruled that all pre-viability prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional. This case revolved around the constitutionality of a Mississippi law that generally prohibited abortion after the fifteenth week of pregnancy. The Supreme Court ruled that the viability line established by Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey should be discarded under a stare decisis analysis. The Court held that the right to an abortion should extend far enough to ensure a reasonable opportunity to choose, but need not extend all the way to viability. In concurring with the Court's judgment, Chief Justice Roberts stated that the viability line never made any sense and that Mississippi's law allows a woman three months to obtain an abortion, well beyond the point at which it is considered "late" to discover a pregnancy.
