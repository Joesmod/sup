Write a concise summary of the following:


accountability with how we use taxpayer funds.  For instance, now businesses are bidding directly on projects with CHA and our third-party professional property managers.  We provide support from various offices across the agency in our new Workforce Opportunity Resource Center.  In addition, CHA now requires professional property management firms to use Section 3 businesses and workers.  CHA spends money with Section 3 businesses in multiple ways, including by assigning projects to our pre-qualified Section 3 contractor pool through unit turn work completed by our professional property managers, and our development partners hiring Section 3 contractors.  By making these changes, more Section 3 businesses, including those that aren't in the pre-qualified contractor pool, have the opportunity to get work.  So now we have a few slides on the definitions of Section 3 that we would like to share with you.  Thank you.  And Chairman, if I may, I'd like to share my screen.  Very well.  Whoever is...  Kamal, if you can give them screen sharing.  Yes, we have the ability to share screen.  Oh, very well, okay.  All right, thank you, Leonard.  So let's move to the second slide.  So I'm just going to provide an overview of the Section 3 Rule and how that God experience has enabled us to grow okay, the of the Section 3 rule and how we got here.  So Section 3 is essentially a rule where federal housing dollars are spent to the greatest extent feasible.  We're creating employment and economic opportunities where those dollars are spent, especially directing them to low and very low income persons and those involved in the federal housing programs, such as our public housing and voucher programs.  So HUD established its new Section 3 rule in November, 2020.  CHA, as well as other public housing authorities began implementing in 2021.  And we are now going to begin reporting under the new rule as of this year.  So again, HUD changed this rule to create more sustainable career


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Section 3 rule requires that federal housing dollars be spent in a way that creates employment and economic opportunities for low- and very low-income people, especially those involved in HUD housing programs. CHA will begin reporting on its compliance with the new rule this year.
