PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


superintendent he talked about like a mentor program.  I can't sound the alarm loud enough that we are losing officers, every single day so it's great to do a victory lap around recruiting, but if we're recruiting and not retaining, it's all for not.  So, this blind spot will continue if we don't incentivize.  And I appreciate that I think that is what we are working, you know, definitely from the budget office perspective we work closely with the police department to ensure that they have the resources they need.  Part of you know the work we're doing around the capital plan, you know, new vehicles improve facilities, these are all things that we want to work with police department on improving and helping with retention of our office one more time, new vehicles are great but if we don't have cops to film, therefore not.  So, I'm terribly disappointed.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Thank you, Alderman Quinn, Alderman Cardenas.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Susie.  I'm going to get back off a little bit of police police funding.  Sorry about that.  The microphone was away from me.  I know right.  It shows you even the microphone is leaving.  I want to talk about the funding ARPA funds is or other other also known as pandemic related funds.  What's what's left of that.  So that's a broader question around.  So the city received ARPA funds not just within the local fiscal recovery but across the board.  I do, I'm going to double check because I know we had that question.  I don't have that number in front of me, but we can go to balance we'll get we'll get that.  And it's important really for doing budget right now to understand what's what's there, what has been expended, and what was left for the following 2023 24 cycle.  And I will say that some of these all these different grant programs have different expiration dates.  And we can provide that through the chair, and of course we need to know those as well because there's a lot of us, you know, and I think it's no secret
