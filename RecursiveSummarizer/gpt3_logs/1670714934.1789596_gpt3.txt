PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


workforce in the 10th Ward, then they should, the prime should secure workforce from that community as well as any other community that is social disadvantaged to meet their needs.  So if they're not socially disadvantaged, then you can't use a worker from those that are not.  Correct.  Well, let me interject here as well.  This is only for that portion of the work.  So there is no restriction on hiring of an individual from a different area, but as far as it counting toward the percentages that we've allotted for local residency in general, that's where that bucket would count.  So if you hire someone from Timbuktu or from whatever, you still have the ability to do that, but the hours counted toward that portion of the obligation will come out of this bucket from individuals that live in the lowest 25% of socially economically disadvantaged areas throughout the city of Chicago.  That's the point.  So we're not saying no to that and only this, but we're saying if you wanna count toward that, we need to come from this particular area of these areas of the city, which I know the department of planning is on can delineate those areas specifically.  That is correct.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  I like your explanation better.  Okay, very good.  It feels like I was going to be a no vote.  All right then, thank you.  No, no, no, no.  That's why we had these conversations so we can get clarity on what it is that we're doing.  All right, now, let me dial.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman.  Was any, okay, so my understanding is that if you are doing construction work that involves the city in a socially disadvantaged area, however that was described, that you can hire your requirement from any other location that is socially disadvantaged in the city of Chicago.  And so my question is, does the community that is the host for the project, do they get first consideration? And if you can't find residents within that socially disadvantaged area, you can then look outside of the area.


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The ordinance being discussed is for the hiring of construction workers for a project in a socially disadvantaged area. The community that is hosting the project should have first consideration for the workforce, but if there are not enough residents from that area that meet the requirements, then workers from other socially disadvantaged areas in the city can be hired.
