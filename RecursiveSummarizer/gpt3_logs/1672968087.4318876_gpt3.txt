outside of the context of the budget.  When we are thinking about a year where we have a surplus where we're able to give upwards of $220 million.  Additionally, the pensions were able to sit on a couple of billion dollars of ARPA funds.  The money is there.  The priorities have to be.  The Chicago Social Justice Memorial was one seven years ago in 2015 when a historic legislation for reparations of survivors of police torture was one.  Seven of the eight demands have been fulfilled and still there is no memorial.  I work with survivors every day.  I work with survivors every day.  I'm watching survivors get older.  Survivors are watching each other pass away.  Their families pass away.  This is justice to not.

We've already raised $500,000 and in seven years we couldn't have gotten there yet.  I think that that's unconscionable.  I think the fact that we are even fighting to get a piece of legislation that has well over 20 co-sponsors that has been sent to the proper committee put onto an agenda is a denial of our voices.  It is demoralizing when we are trying to get people to be civically engaged.  We're watching and it's

RESPONSE:

We are asking for $2.25 million to build a memorial for survivors of police torture. We've already raised $500,000, but we haven't been able to get the memorial built yet. This is because the city, county, and state have all been complicit in the torture.
