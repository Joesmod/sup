CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The bill defines "low-emission aviation technologies" as technologies that significantly improve aircraft fuel efficiency, increase the utilization of sustainable aviation fuel, or reduce greenhouse gas emissions produced during the operation of civil aircraft. It also defines "sustainable aviation fuel" as a liquid fuel produced in the United States that meets certain standards, is derived from biomass, waste streams, renewable energy sources, or gaseous carbon oxides, and achieves at least a 50 percent lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction in comparison to petroleum-based jet fuel.
