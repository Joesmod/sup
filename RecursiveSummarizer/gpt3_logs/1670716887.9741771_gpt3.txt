PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


things that we heard over and over again is that is what sure it is and lenders and what counts and construction is liquidity.  And so you might have a bunch of other assets but if you can't liquidate them fairly quickly, that lenders are going to essentially discount them to nothing because as far as they're concerned if you can't pay your crews, you can't pay your suppliers.  If you can't finance your jobs now, the fact that maybe six or 12 months or two years from now you could sell this thing really isn't very useful.  We also suggested a tweak, which was to remove the restriction on only certified MWV's that their full time workforce must be in the six county region.  This is something that non MWV's do not labor under, and it just seemed, frankly, not really related to the issues.  Chicago was an outlier in requiring this I full disclosure I wrote that.  31 years ago, but I think we certainly learned that that's really a restriction that can hurt MWV's to no real purpose.  But do want to stress that the business itself must still be located in the region, and that the overall Chicago residency ordinance was unaffected by this change.  Next slide please.  So continuing our recommendations, of course, pay promptly, pay promptly, pay promptly.  Not much more really to say about that except that, as I'm sure you all know, the mayor has appointed a prompt payment task force, which is hard at work on making recommendations and addressing ways to speed up payment, which really is just critical.  We also suggested addressing delays in initial certification application processing and recertification application processing.  And one of the tweaks, it seems like a small thing unless you're actually a certified firm, which is to follow along the federal model, and that your certification does not expire.  It would actually have to be removed so so this takes away an issue that some certified firms that had that the city was slow and getting their research letters out to
