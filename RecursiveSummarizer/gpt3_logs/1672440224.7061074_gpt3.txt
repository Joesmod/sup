annual appropriation.  No votes were taken.  And finally, the subcommittee on the Chicago recovery plan also met on December 7th and discussed environmental justice initiatives and community climate initiatives.  No votes were taken and that concludes my report.  Thank you, Chairman Dowell.  Next up the Committee on Economic Capital and Technology Development Chairman Villegas.  Good afternoon, Madam President and members of the City Council reporting for the Committee on Economic Capital and Technology Development.  Tuesday, December 6th, 2022, the committee held an in-person meeting and recommends passage of the following items.  Items one and two are appointments to one special service area collectively voted on by the committee members and introduced by Mayor Lightfoot during November 16th, 2022 City Council meeting.  Appointments of Yvette Leon, Lexi Galleas to SSA number 13 Stockyards Commission located in the third, 11th, 12th and 20th wards.  I move for passage of these appointments by the first favorable roll call vote of the Committee on Finance and the associated unsuccessful motion to reconsider.  Hearing no objections so ordered.  Before reporting on the following items, I would be remiss if I did not highlight the success of our annual special service area hearings and the overall budget process.  A big thank you to the attentive and collaborative partnership with the Department of Planning and Development, specifically Mark Rocha and Mary O'Connor both went above and beyond and helped us meet critical deadlines to fund special service areas throughout the city, ensuring services encouraging economic development are provided.  Items three and 22 items three through 22 on the agenda are series of ordinances on tax levy scope of services budget and management agreements to various special service areas were collectively voted on by committee members and introduced by Mayor Lightfoot during the October 26 2022 and November 16th 2022 City Council meetings.
