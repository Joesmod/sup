None of these leading cases, in short, provides a template for what the Court does today.  The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that a state may ban abortion after fifteen weeks of pregnancy. The Court's opinion, written by Justice Thomas, states that the previously recognized abortion right does not necessarily extend to all abortion restrictions prior to viability. Justice Kagan, joined by Justices Breyer and Sotomayor, dissents from the opinion. Kagan writes that the Court's opinion and the dissent both display a "relentless freedom from doubt" on the legal issue at hand. She states that she is not sure that a ban on abortion from the moment of conception must be treated the same under the Constitution as a ban after fifteen weeks of pregnancy. She would have decided the question before the Court only on the narrow issue of whether the previously recognized abortion right bars all abortion restrictions prior to viability. Kagan argues that the Court's ruling will have a significant impact on women's equality and liberty. She writes that the government can no longer control a woman's body or the course of a woman's life, and that this ruling will force women to make difficult and consequential decisions about their lives without full autonomy.  The Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization case was a challenge to a Mississippi law that prohibited abortions after the 15th week of pregnancy. The majority opinion, written by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, upheld the law, reasoning that it was a legitimate regulation of abortion and did not pose a substantial obstacle to a woman's right to choose. Dissenting opinions were filed by Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. The dissenters argued that the law was an unconstitutional infringement on a woman's right to choose, and that it would lead to more restrictive laws being passed in other states. They also criticized the majority for not providing adequate protection for women who might be harmed by the law, such as those who are the victims of rape or incest.  In the wake of today's decision, a state law will criminalize the woman's conduct if she seeks or obtains an abortion, incarcerating or fining her for doing so. This will have a particularly harsh effect on women who lack financial resources and will not be able to travel to another state for a procedure. The majority opinion tries to downplay the effects of the decision, but it is clear that this will have a major impact on women's rights and their status as equal citizens.  Today's majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization casts serious doubt on the future of reproductive rights in the United States.
