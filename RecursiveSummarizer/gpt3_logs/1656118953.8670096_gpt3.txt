Write a detailed summary of the following:

a century after 1868—including “another half-century” after women gained the constitutional right to vote in 1920, see post, at 15; Amdt. 19—it was firmly established that laws prohibiting abortion like the Texas law at issue in Roe were permissible exercises of state regulatory authority. And today, another half century later, more than half of the States have asked us to overrule Roe and Casey. The dissent cannot establish that a right to abortion has ever been part of this Nation’s tradition. 2 Because the dissent cannot argue that the abortion right is rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition, it contends that the “constitutional tradition” is “not captured whole at a single moment,” and that its “meaning gains content from the long sweep of our history and from successive judicial precedents.” Post, at 18 (internal quotation marks omitted). This vague formulation imposes no clear restraints on what Justice White called the “exercise of raw judicial power,” Roe, 410 U. S., at 222 (dissenting opinion), and while the dissent claims that its standard “does not mean Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 37 Opinion of the Court anything goes,” post, at 17, any real restraints are hard to discern. The largely limitless reach of the dissenters’ standard is illustrated by the way they apply it here. First, if the “long sweep of history” imposes any restraint on the recognition of unenumerated rights, then Roe was surely wrong, since abortion was never allowed (except to save the life of the mother) in a majority of States for over 100 years before that decision was handed down. Second, it is impossible to defend Roe based on prior precedent because all of the precedents Roe cited, including Griswold and Eisenstadt, were critically different for a reason that we have explained: None of those cases involved the destruction of what Roe called “potential life.” See supra, at 32. So without support in history or relevant precedent, Roe’s reasoning cannot be defended even under the dissent’s proposed test, and the dissent is forced to rely solely on the fact that a constitutional right to abortion was recognized in Roe and later decisions that accepted Roe’s interpretation. Under the doctrine of stare decisis, those precedents are entitled to careful and respectful consideration, and we engage in that analysis below. But as the Court has reiterated time and time again, adherence to precedent is not “‘an inexorable command.’” Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC, 576 U. S. 446, 455 (2015). There are occasions when past decisions should be overruled, and as we will explain, this is one of them. 3 The most striking feature of the dissent is the absence of any serious discussion of the legitimacy of the States’ interest in protecting fetal life. This is evident in the analogy that the dissent draws between the abortion right and the rights recognized in Griswold (contraception), Eisenstadt (same), Lawrence (sexual conduct with member of the same sex), and

DETAILED SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

The Court begins by noting that, a century after the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, it is well-established that laws prohibiting abortion, like the Texas law at issue in Roe v. Wade, are permissible exercises of state regulatory authority. The Court then observes that, in the more than half a century since Roe was decided, a majority of the States have asked the Court to overturn that decision. The Court next turns to the dissent's argument that the right to abortion is rooted in this country's history and tradition. The Court explains that, because the dissent cannot argue that the abortion right is rooted in this Nation's history and tradition, it instead relies on the proposition that the "constitutional tradition" is "not captured whole at a single moment," and that its "meaning gains content from the long sweep of our history and from successive judicial precedents." The Court observes that, under the dissent's proposed test, Roe v. Wade would surely be wrong, because abortion was never allowed (except to save the life of the mother) in a majority of States for over 100 years before that decision was handed down. The Court also explains that it is impossible to defend Roe on the basis of prior precedent because all of the precedents Roe cited, including Griswold v. Connecticut and Eisenstadt v. Baird, were critically different for a reason: None of those cases involved the destruction of what Roe called "potential life." The Court then turns to the dissent's argument that, under the doctrine of stare decisis, Roe and subsequent decisions that have accepted Roe's interpretation of the Constitution are entitled to careful and respectful consideration. The Court explains that, while adherence to precedent is important, it is not an "inexorable command," and there are occasions when past decisions should be overruled. The Court concludes that, in light of the history and tradition of the States in regulating abortion, as well as the lack of any serious discussion of the legitimacy of the States' interest in protecting fetal life in the dissent, this is one of those occasions.
