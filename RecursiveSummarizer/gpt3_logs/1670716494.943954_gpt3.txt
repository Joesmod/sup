limits contract value for MBI is 3 million to 20 million.  And SBI is up to 3 million.  So an SBI is up to 3 million and an MBI is up to 20 million? Correct.  Okay.  My question is Mr.  Chair.

RESPONSE:

The Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) has established a pool of pre-qualified contractors, known as job order contracting vendors, with businesses that meet the federal government's Section 3 requirements. In 2020, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) implemented new Section 3 requirements for all public housing authorities across the country that focus on labor hour benchmarks instead of percentage of the contract value. The CHA's contractors must now meet targets of labor hours for CHA residents and participants, low-income residents of Chicago, and residents of areas of high poverty in Chicago.
