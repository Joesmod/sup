precedent. And to the extent States have laws that set the cutoff date earlier than fifteen weeks, any litigation over that timeframe would proceed free of the distorting effect that the viability rule has had on our constitutional debate. The same could be true, for that matter, with respect to legislative consideration in the States. We would then be free to exercise our discretion in deciding whether and when to take up the issue, from a more informed perspective. * * * Both the Court’s opinion and the dissent display a relentless freedom from doubt on the legal issue that I cannot share. I am not sure, for example, that a ban on terminating a pregnancy from the moment of conception must be treated the same under the Constitution as a ban after fifteen weeks. A thoughtful Member of this Court once counseled that the difficulty of a question “admonishes us to observe the wise limitations on our function and to confine ourselves to deciding only what is necessary to the disposition of the immediate case.” Whitehouse v. Illinois Central R. Co., 349 U. S. 366, 372–373 (1955) (Frankfurter, J., for the Court). I would decide the question we granted review to answer—whether the previously recognized abortion right bars all abortion restrictions prior to viability, such that a ban on abortions after fifteen weeks of pregnancy is necessarily unlawful. The answer to that question is no, and there is no need to go further to decide this case. I therefore concur only in the judgment.

Roe held, and Casey reaffirmed, that the Constitution safeguards a woman’s right to decide for herself whether to bear a child. Roe held, and Casey reaffirmed, that in the first stages of pregnancy, the government could not make that choice for women. The government could not control a woman’s body or the course of a woman’s life: It could not determine what the woman’s future would be. See Casey, 505 U. S., at 853; Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U. S. 124, 171–172 (2007) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Respecting a woman as an autonomous being, and granting her full equality, meant giving her substantial choice over this most personal and most consequential of all life decisions. Roe and Casey well understood the difficulty and divisiveness of the abortion issue. The Court knew that Americans hold profoundly different

DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that a state may ban abortion after fifteen weeks of pregnancy. The Court's opinion, written by Justice Thomas, states that the previously recognized abortion right does not necessarily extend to all abortion restrictions prior to viability. Justice Kagan, joined by Justices Breyer and Sotomayor, dissents from the opinion. Kagan writes that the Court's opinion and the dissent both display a "relentless freedom from doubt" on the legal issue at hand. She states that she is not sure that a ban on abortion from the moment of conception must be treated the same under the Constitution as a ban after fifteen weeks of pregnancy. She would have decided the question before the Court only on the narrow issue of whether the previously recognized abortion right bars all abortion restrictions prior to viability. Kagan argues that the Court's ruling will have a significant impact on women's equality and liberty. She writes that the government can no longer control a woman's body or the course of a woman's life, and that this ruling will force women to make difficult and consequential decisions about their lives without full autonomy.
