they were able to they're very skeptical about this project and its ability to be financed.  And that would explain why Bally's went to Oak Street capital, good Chicago business here, to secure 500 million dollars in funding, 200 million of it through a land sale lease back and another 300 million dollars in available equity.  That's a half a million dollars for a 1.7 billion dollar project.  In fact, Bally's during the zoning committee hearing admitted that if Bally's defaults, Oak Street will own this casino.  And do we know Oak Street has a lot of proficiency in running them? I know they bankroll them, but we know that they're any good at running them.  So something to consider.  I could go on and on and on about traffic and safety and why we should be very skeptical about this project, but I won't.  I would just say remember this day and who knows what the Illinois gaming board's going to do.  But people in this room raise these red flags now and I hope to God they don't come true because Alderman Burnett is correct.  The city is very much depending on this project to be successful and not just the city but our pension funds.  So we've made a very meaningful important important decision here.  Obviously we can all agree to disagree, but I really do hope that the opponents of the casino are somehow wrong.  I don't think we are, but I hope so because literally our pension fund's future is depending on it.  I'll be voting no.  Chairman Tani, back to you.  Thank you Mayor and thank you colleagues.  I just want to remind our committee that the casino vote has already happened.  What we're in front of this zoning is some modifications to the plan development, which obviously took out some parking, but primarily they had to go back to the plan commission because there was somewhat some changes.  So the arguments for and against, we've heard this a couple of months ago, and I do as chairman of the committee, I want to give a little more of a little chronology on this
