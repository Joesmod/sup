what are we calling it now.  I believe it is the Office of Climate and Environmental Equity.  Got it.  So what I don't understand, why did we choose not to create a Department of Environment in the budget this year I understand number my colleagues been calling for this and frankly I thought it was a mistake when the city did away with it, years ago.  Why do we need to have a separate office outside the mayor's office that's going to do a study to determine whether we need a department I think we all know we do need one.  Why not just go ahead and create a department.  So I what I will say is this I know I've had with many people here a lot of conversations around, you know, from the initial proposal and the recommendation where it's said as a office within the mayor's office, and a lot of conversation about, about why it should be pulled out, and a separate office slash department.  I think before it gets to a department, you know what we see in the management ordinance that we'll talk about in that item is a lot of work of when we took apart the Department of Environment, a lot of the roles and responsibilities in that department were put out to other departments.  I think there's work that we need to do that's not that you know could not have happened in the last 40 to 72 hours however long we've been having this conversation of what started to really build out a robust Department of Environment.  So this is a good first step I think we have we've heard, you know, I've talked to a lot of people here about why it's important to have it outside.  And so you know what you see before you is that first step you know we've added additional positions from when we originally started with what we see in the management ordinance is that there will be work going on.  And, you know, we are commissioning a study to really look at where all those roles went.  So what do we pull back in, and you know hopefully in 2024 we will come back with a robust departments.  Well, then
