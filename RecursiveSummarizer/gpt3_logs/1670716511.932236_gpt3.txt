your constituents if they have questions on these changes, you all have my information and just reach out to me as needed.  All right.  You know, the last question I'll come up with, and this is something that was just raised to me recently about utilization of Section 3 at the 10% of the contracts, when in the past it was over the CHA portion of the commitment, but now it's being made over the entire contract value, if there's CHA money, city money and other money attached to that.  Is that, was that assertion correct? Not, yeah, we'll confirm that and get that answer back to you.  Yeah.  Okay.  And the other question.  Mr.  Chairman, I do have a question.  Okay.  Give me the, hold on this one.  I'm sorry, I didn't raise it.  No, no, no problem at all.  Was in relation to Section 3 and a signatory, signatory contractors and some, the number of signatory Section 3 contractors existing versus the work that has to be done and what, how did you all attempt to work through that challenge? Cause it seems like, as I understand it, correct me if I'm wrong, that there are a small number of signatory Section 3 contractors.  Right.  So when it comes to the question of union versus non-union, you know, for us, we're agnostic to that.  When it comes to our Section 3 commitment, what's important is that you're certified as Section 3, you have the appropriate number of labor hours, et cetera.  So we don't really look at, you know, union versus non-union as a metric or a bar to do work with CHA.  But if the Section 3 contractors are not signatory and they're working for a signatory general, how would they to meet the requirement? If you have a 10% contract on a $20 million project and you need $2 million worth of, in theory, Section 3 participation, and I don't know how many they are, but you know, the numbers are probably a fairly low.  How do you meet that goal? That's on that project.  And let's say you got five projects going.  How can you meet that goal in that environment?


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The question is about how to meet the goal of 10% Section 3 participation on a project when there are only a few signatory Section 3 contractors. CHA says that they don't look at union vs. non-union as a metric, but rather focus on whether the contractor is certified and has the appropriate number of labor hours, etc.
