Write a concise summary of the following:


other one of our contracts.  JOC really is our way to fill in the gap areas.  Just some basic level examples, the flat work, site work, some of like the CDOT jurisdiction plazas throughout the city, or where there's like a unique brick paver might be material that our in-house forces can't acquire.  Or there might be a certain kind of decorative crosswalk where we don't have the equipment or access to material to do the work.  We will utilize JOC, the JOC contract to assist with that.  With regards to the structures, same thing, bridges, viaducts, we'll have situations where a lot of stuff with maybe like the bridge houses where there might be some masonry or roof repair where we don't have the right trades or access to material.  I know some of the unique bridge work might require some different sort of crane to access, a difficult location.  Just some of the unique things that come up with maintaining our bridges throughout the city.  We sometimes don't have the right equipment.  Or the other caveat with the bridge stuff that does come up is our in-house forces might be tied up on some other projects and we identify something that's in need of quick repair.  And we don't, it's a resource allocation and we can utilize, go to the JOC to make that repair while maintaining what our current workforce project is on.  So again, just to summarize, we utilize JOC to really fill in the gap areas to make sure we're getting projects completed.  And I'd be happy to answer any questions from the committee.  Thank you.  One question I will pose, we know that this is a new set of contracts that you've just entered to.  The previous contracts for this similar type of work, on a percentage basis, how much did you all utilize of the JOC on the last contract that you had? And do you recall the amount of the contract, of these similar type contracts that you had previously? Sure, Alderman.  So short answer is we maxed out the value on those contracts.  We utilize them to their full
