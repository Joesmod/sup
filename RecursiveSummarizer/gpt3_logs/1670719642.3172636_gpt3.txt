CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

A Jewish man and a Christian woman who are engaged to be married ask a Jewish website designer to build a website to celebrate their nuptials. The website designer explains that many Jews consider intermarriage an existential threat to the future of Judaism, and so the website would need to accept the second couple. However, if the website is offered mostly or exclusively to Jews, then the designer would not be required to sell it to the interreligious couple.
