JUSTICE ALITO: Okay. Do you agree with Mr. Olson that a -- a website for marriages can tailor the website in a way that makes the website unacceptable to same-sex couples?  MR. FLETCHER: By saying, for  instance, we -- on every website, we believe that marriage is only between one man and one woman or something like that, yes, we do.

JUSTICE ALITO: Isn't that kind of a silly distinction? MR. FLETCHER: Justice Alito, respectfully, no, I -- I don't think it is. I think it's one that's familiar both to public accommodations laws and to the First Amendment. So, in the public accommodations context, as Mr. Olson said, you
