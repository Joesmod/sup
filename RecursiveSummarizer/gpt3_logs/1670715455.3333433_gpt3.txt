Write a concise summary of the following:


a conversation you want to have either tomorrow at City Council or at a later date with planning or housing that might be a better way to go.  I don't I don't know if that came up in any of your community conversations but I think I'm not sure if we've got someone on housing that could directly answer that but I think Brian Essenberg from the Department of Housing would be the appropriate person to talk to about that.  Thank you chairman.  So, yeah, I think in terms of the OH we can have the conversation tomorrow.  I think that I think that would be important to have the conversation, pending that I'm okay with moving, you know, to tomorrow and I will encourage the applicant as well as the OH to have this conversation tomorrow before the full council.  Thank you, Captain and did you have a question or comment.  Very quick question.  Was this city property that was purchased to do this development.  No.  The entire lot, including beyond that 19 foot year area was purchased in 1970 at a tax sale for reasons unknown, the parcel was sold in 1979, except for the bag 19 feet of this lot.  So it's been in this condition since since 1979.  Okay.  That makes a lot more sense.  Our state law says we cannot provide mandates we can only provide incentives for affordable housing, if they purchased a property from the city at a reduced rate, then we could mandate the ARL but under this circumstance it sounds like we cannot.  Any further questions or can I get a motion recommend approval this item by the affirmative vote of all members present for the role called the term quorum.  So David Moore, all the men David more so moves hearing no objection so ordered do pass recommendation to this ordinance will be reported out the next city council meeting on Wednesday October 26 2022.  Two more items on the agenda item number seven is the sale of 20 city lots to inherent l three C subject to redevelopment agreement under the city lots for working families program to conduct to construct
