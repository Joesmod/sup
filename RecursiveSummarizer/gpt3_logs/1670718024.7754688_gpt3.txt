PROMPT:

Write an explanation as to how the following will benefit the City:


more questions and I'm done.  On the improvement and preservation side we were at 35% dollars out the door, 35% units supported.  I know that that's been another challenge and I think a similar challenge related to the GC work that you're talking about.  Do we anticipate getting to 100% units and dollars this year or do we think there's going to be a carryover? I think a lot of the preservation side was acquisition activity.  What we have seen is the cost of purchase has been really high and there's a lot of investors in the market and now with the interest rates changing maybe that's going to change.  A lot of the groups that were helping provide access to credit too didn't have options to even buy.  As they were going to buy stuff they were bought.  One of the challenges we have is speed.  How fast can I give someone money to go buy a building? How fast enough is the open market? That's why we work with our nonprofits.  They're always getting bid out.  What I'm really hoping and this is the unfortunate side is we're being told that the REOs are coming.  The result of the foreclosures are not foreclosing.  That's going to be this next wave for everybody.  The difference being is now we're seeing them so we're teed up.  We have access to credit.  We have developers that want them.  They're chomping for them.  How do we just go do that? Okay.  Appreciate it.  I think that's one of the conversations we're going to have with our immunable depositories in a little bit.  Last question because I feel like the next time we talk it will be in January but it will be like past time for this question.  We almost talked about homelessness yesterday and I would love to talk about it for a moment.  I know that DOH is working to stand up winter housing, looking at non-congregate housing options.  Can you talk a little bit about what that work is looking like right now? I mean, homelessness for department housing is actually very, very new.  When I joined the department, our role
