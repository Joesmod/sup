Write a concise summary of the following:

constitutional scrutiny unless the regulation is a mere pretex[t] designed to effect an invidious discrimination against members of one sex or the other. Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 U. S. 484, 496, n. 20 (1974). And as the Court has stated, the goal of preventing abortion does not constitute invidiously discriminatory animus against women. Bray v. Alexandria Womens Health Clinic, 506 U. S. 263, 273274 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, laws regulating or prohibiting abortion are not subject to heightened scrutiny. Rather, they are governed by the same standard of review as other health and safety measures.18 With this new theory addressed, we turn to Caseys bold assertion that the abortion right is an aspect of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 505 U. S., at 846; Brief for Respondents 17; Brief for United States 2122. 2 The underlying theory on which this argument rests that the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause provides substantive, as well as procedural, protection for libertyhas long been controversial. But our decisions have held that the Due Process Clause protects two categories of substantive rights. The first consists of rights guaranteed by the first eight Amendments. Those Amendments originally applied only to the Federal Government, Barron ex rel. Tiernan v. Mayor of Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243, 247251 (1833) (opinion for the Court by Marshall, C. J.), but this Court has held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates the great majority of those rights and thus makes them equally applicable to the States. See McDonald, 561  18We discuss this standard in Part VI of this opinion.   12 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court U. S., at 763767, and nn. 1213. The second category which is the one in question herecomprises a select list of fundamental rights that are not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution. In deciding whether a right falls into either of these categories, the Court has long asked whether the right is deeply rooted in [our] history and tradition and whether it is essential to our Nations scheme of ordered liberty. Timbs v. Indiana, 586 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (slip op., at 3) (internal quotation marks omitted); McDonald, 561 U. S., at 764, 767 (internal quotation marks omitted); Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 721 (internal quotation marks omitted).19 And in conducting this inquiry, we have engaged in a careful analysis of the history of the right at issue. Justice Ginsburgs opinion for the Court in Timbs is a recent example. In concluding that the Eighth Amendments protection against excessive fines is fundamental to our scheme of ordered liberty and deeply rooted in this Nations history and tradition, 586 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7) (internal quotation marks omitted), her opinion traced the right back to Magna Carta, Blackstones Commentaries, and 35 of the 37 state

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Court has held that laws regulating or prohibiting abortion are not subject to heightened scrutiny, but are instead governed by the same standard of review as other health and safety measures. The Court has also held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects two categories of substantive rights: those guaranteed by the first eight Amendments, and a select list of fundamental rights that are not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution. In order to determine whether a right falls into either of these categories, the Court asks whether the right is deeply rooted in our history and tradition and whether it is essential to our Nation's scheme of ordered liberty.
