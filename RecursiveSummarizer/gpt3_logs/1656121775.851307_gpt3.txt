PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:

contraception. Over the course of three cases, the Court had held that a right to use and gain access to contraception was part of the Fourteenth Amendments guarantee of liberty. See Griswold, 381 U. S. 479; Eisenstadt, 405 U. S. 438; Carey v. Population Services Intl, 431 U. S. 678 (1977). That clause, we explained, necessarily conferred a right to be free from unwarranted governmental intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision whether to bear or beget a child. Eisenstadt, 405 U. S., at 453; see Carey, 431 U. S., at 684685. Casey saw Roe as of a piece: In critical respects the abortion decision is of the same character. 505 U. S., at 852. [R]easonable people, the Court noted, could also oppose contraception; and indeed, they could believe that some forms of contraception similarly implicate a concern with potential life. Id., at 853, 859. Yet the views of others could not automatically prevail against a womans right to control her own body and make her own choice about whether to bear, and probably to raise, a child. When an unplanned pregnancy is involved because either contraception or abortion is outlawedthe liberty of the woman is at stake in a sense unique to the human condition. Id., at 852. No State could undertake to resolve the moral questions raised in such a definitive way as to deprive a woman of all choice. Id., at 850. Faced with all these connections between Roe/Casey and judicial decisions recognizing other constitutional rights, Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 25 BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting the majority tells everyone not to worry. It can (so it says) neatly extract the right to choose from the constitutional edifice without affecting any associated rights. (Think of someone telling you that the Jenga tower simply will not collapse.) Todays decision, the majority first says, does not undermine the decisions cited by Roe and Caseythe ones involving marriage, procreation, contraception, [and] family relationshipsin any way. Ante, at 32; Casey, 505 U. S., at 851. Note that this first assurance does not extend to rights recognized after Roe and Casey, and partly based on themin particular, rights to same-sex intimacy and marriage. See supra, at 23.6 On its later tries, though, the majority includes those too: Nothing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion. Ante, at 66; see ante, at 7172. That right is unique, the majority asserts, because [abortion] terminates life or potential life. Ante, at 66 (internal quotation marks omitted); see ante, at 32, 7172. So the majority depicts todays decision as a restricted railroad ticket, good for this day and train only. Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649, 669 (1944) (Roberts, J., dissenting). Should the audience for these too-much-repeated protestations be duly satisfied? We think not. The first problem with the majoritys account comes from JUSTICE

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that a right to use and gain access to contraception is part of the Fourteenth Amendments guarantee of liberty. This right to contraception is of the same character as the right to abortion, and the Court has ruled that no state can deprive a woman of her right to abortion.
