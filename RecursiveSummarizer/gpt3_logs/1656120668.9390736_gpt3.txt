abortion in the United States.  In the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution does not take sides on the issue of abortion. The Court held that it is up to the people and their elected representatives to resolve the issue through the democratic process.  In his concurring opinion in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, Justice Kavanaugh argues that the Constitution does not outlaw abortion or guarantee a right to abortion, but instead leaves the question up to the people to decide through the democratic process. He respect those who advocate for both positions, but argues that both are wrong as a constitutional matter. He states that today's decision does not outlaw abortion throughout the United States, and that the question of abortion should be left up to the states to decide.
