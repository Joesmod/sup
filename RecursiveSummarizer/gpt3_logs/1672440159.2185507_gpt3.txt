Thank You Mr.  Stoller for your comments.  Our next speaker is Justin Williams.  Hello members of the City Council.  Far South Side residents have been waiting since 1968 for the Red Line extension when it was promised by Mayor Richard J Daly.

It will connect people to jobs and amenities throughout the city and reduce travel times to the loop by 30 minutes.  It will benefit the city as a whole by giving employers access to an expanded labor market, increasing development potential of underutilized land, increasing tax revenues, and helping the city meet its climate action plan transportation goals.  This project also centers racial equity in its financing.  Our organizations do not always support tips.  As a market-based tool, tips are too often used in areas where developers already want to invest due to the overly broad definition of blight.  Tips are too infrequently used to finance projects in areas that have little development momentum because of the inability to raise sufficient funds.  In the case of the Red Line extension, the wealth generation
