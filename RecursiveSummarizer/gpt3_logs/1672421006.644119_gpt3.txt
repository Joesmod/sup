have refused to renew contracts, because it's not technology that's working, it's not keeping us safe.  And in the instance, in many instances, it's actually harming Chicago and so I'm disappointed that ShotSpotter continues to be in this contract.  And on the issue of reopening the shutter mental health clinics, that was something that was also promised to the people of the city of Chicago and so this is the last budget of this term, where we have an opportunity to accomplish that.  And it's just deeply disappointing that despite the fact that mental health experts, clinicians, entire coalition of Chicagoans organizing around the treatment not trauma proposal have been fighting to reopen those shuttered mental health clinics, using them as an anchor for a non police mental health first responder program.  This budget fails in that regard.  So, I've got to say this budget appropriation for me, and for my community and the people that I represent has a lot to be desired.  Thank you.  Thank you, Alderman Ramirez Rosa Alderman Rodriguez.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I'd like to add on to the course regarding the Department of Environment, I think we should have gotten it done this time around, and I'm really upset that we did it.  With that said, I have read through to 31 050 section for, and I do have some questions about this proposed study.  Just to add clarity.  What is this study exactly exactly looking at is looking at feasibility, you know I brought questions to start.  What exactly will this study look, look at.  I think what we do when we get to number 10, which is in the management ordinance, is that we are looking at the whole realm of kind of feasibility, what best practices are you know what the best Department of Environment around the country look like looking within about who has what responsibilities right now within city government within the department so that you know we are thoughtfully pulling that apart if that's kind of you know where we end up at
