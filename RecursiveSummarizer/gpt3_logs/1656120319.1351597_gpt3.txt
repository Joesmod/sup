early stages." However, the fact that many states in the 19th century did criminalize abortion, and that the common law was far from uniform on the issue, belies this claim. In addition, Roe v. Wade and subsequent cases have imposed significant restrictions on abortion after quickening, so the claim that women could generally terminate a pregnancy in its early stages is not accurate. Ultimately, the Supreme Court should not rely on Means' work or any other flawed scholarship when making decisions on such a sensitive and important issue.  In his dissent from the denial of certiorari in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, Justice Thomas argues that the fact that pre-quickening abortions were not criminalized in the late 18th and early 19th centuries does not mean that there was a belief that states lacked the authority to do so. He points to the fact that, as the century progressed, legislatures began enacting laws criminalizing abortion, with no one arguing that these laws violated a fundamental right. He notes that the common law consistently condemned abortion and described it as an "unlawful" act, regardless of whether it occurred before or after quickening. Justice Thomas goes on to dismiss the argument, put forward by some amici curiae, that the state criminal statutes criminalizing abortion which were in effect at the time the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted were motivated by illegitimate reasons such as racism or anti-Catholicism. He argues that this argument is based on the statements of a single prominent individual and is therefore not representative of the views of the legislators as a whole. He concludes by asserting that the hundreds of state legislators who voted to criminalize abortion cannot be said to have been motivated by illegitimate reasons.  The law in question was motivated by a sincere belief that abortion kills a human being. This belief was held by many judicial decisions from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The law was also motivated by a desire to suppress the size of the African-American population.  The Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), K.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently released a report on abortion surveillance in the United States for 2019. The report includes data on the number of abortions, the abortion rate, the distribution of abortions by characteristics of the women obtaining them, and the methods used to obtain abortions. The CDC found that there were 862,320 abortions in the United States in 2019, a decrease of 2% from 2018. The abortion rate was 13.5 abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age, also a decrease from 2018. The majority of abortions (61.1%) were obtained by women in their 20s, and the majority of abortions (72.3%) were performed at or before 8 weeks of gestation. The most common method of abortion was medication abortion (39.7%), followed by aspiration (28.5%). The report also includes data on the number of abortions by state, race/ethnicity, and age. In 2019, the states with the highest numbers of reported abortions were California (172,550), New York (118,350), and Florida (93,750). The states with the lowest numbers of reported abortions were Wyoming (210), South Dakota (430), and Alaska (530). The states with the highest abortion rates were New Jersey (20.8), New York (19.7), and Maryland (19.4). The report concludes with a discussion of the limitations of the data and the need for more research on abortion.
