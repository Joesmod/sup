from conception onward, with no exceptions for rape or incest. The majority opinion, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, argues that the right to abortion is not recognized in the Constitution. Thomas cites the Fourteenth Amendment, ratified in 1868, which he says does not protect a woman's right to end a pregnancy. The majority opinion also criticizes the Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion nationwide, for its "balance" between a woman's right to abortion and the state's interest in protecting fetal life. Justice Stephen Breyer, writing in dissent, argues that the majority opinion is "a radical decision" that will harm women's health and equality. Breyer also criticizes the majority for its "rejection of the idea of balancing interests" in constitutional law.  The Dobbs case is about whether the Fourteenth Amendment protects a woman's right to have an abortion. The majority opinion refers to some later and earlier history in order to support its argument that the amendment does not protect this right. On the one side of 1868, the majority goes back as far as the 13th century. However, this is not relevant to the majority's argument. The majority opinion also notes that many States barred abortion up to the time of Roe. However, this is not relevant either because post-ratification adoption or acceptance of laws that are inconsistent with the original meaning of the constitutional text cannot overcome or alter that text. The majority's core legal postulate is that we in the 21st century must read the Fourteenth Amendment just as its ratifiers did.  In this excerpt from a dissent, Justice Breyer (joined by Sotomayor and Kagan) takes issue with the majority's view that the right to abortion does not exist because it was not part of the original understanding of the Fourteenth Amendment. He argues that this view ignores the fact that women were not considered full members of the community when the amendment was ratified, and that times have changed since then. Casey itself recognized that the Constitution does not protect men and women alike, and that women's status in society has changed. Therefore, the right to abortion should be recognized as part of the right to liberty.  The U.S. Constitution grants rights to women that it did not in 1868. This is because the Constitution is written to adapt to changing circumstances over time. The Fourteenth Amendment's liberty clause guarantees access to contraception, which was not legally protected in 1868. This clause also protected a woman's right to end a pregnancy in its earlier stages. Today, the Court has rejected the majority's view that the Constitution should be read in a narrow, historically circumscribed manner. Instead, the Court has kept true to the Framers' principles by applying them in new ways, responsive to new societal understandings and conditions.  In Obergefell v. Hodges, the Supreme Court considered whether the Fourteenth Amendment requires states to issue marriage licenses
