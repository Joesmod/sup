JUSTICE GORSUCH: I -- I -- I -- I'm sorry. JUSTICE KAGAN: No, no, no. JUSTICE GORSUCH: One can view these websites, or last time around we had cakes, as either expressing the maker's point of view or the couple's point of view, and -- and that's really at -- at the heart of a lot of this. And I guess I'm -- I'm a little confused because sometimes, as I -- as I understand it, you're saying inherently here it is my client's point of view and not just the couple's point of view.

RESPONSE:

The conversation is about the line between a person's right to free speech and the government's ability to compel speech. In this case, the question is whether a website designer can be forced to create a website that advocates for same-sex marriage, even if they don't agree with that view. Justices Gorsuch and Kagan are questioning whether the website designer's speech is their own speech or the speech of the couple getting married. Colorado has said in the past that cake makers don't have to make cakes that advocate against same-sex marriage, because that would be the cake maker's speech, not just the couple's speech. The question is how to draw a line between free speech and compelled speech in a way that is clear and consistent.
