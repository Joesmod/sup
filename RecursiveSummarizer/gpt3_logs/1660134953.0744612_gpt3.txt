RESPONSE:

The section amends the definition of "qualified facility" for purposes of the energy investment tax credit to include qualified biogas property and microgrid controllers. Qualified biogas property is defined as property part of a system which cleans or conditions biogas for use, and construction of which begins before 2025. A microgrid controller is defined as equipment part of a qualified microgrid, which is designed and used to monitor and control the energy resources and loads on such microgrid. Construction of a microgrid controller must begin before 2025.
