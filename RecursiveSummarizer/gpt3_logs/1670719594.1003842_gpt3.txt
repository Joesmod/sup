provides the chairs are also providing the services in a wedding that they don't like. So why are they any different? MS. WAGGONER: The person providing the chairs isn't providing speech, but when you're engaging in symbolic speech, whether that be through the creation of a custom wedding cake or a custom wedding website, you are creating speech. I can't -- JUSTICE KAGAN: Even though the site doesn't say anything about that? It doesn't say, wow, gay marriage is a wonderful thing.
