CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Polymeric Backsheet is a sheet on the back of a solar module which acts as an electric insulator and protects the inner components of such module from the surrounding environment. The Solar Grade Polysilicon is silicon which is purified to a minimum purity of 99.999999 percent silicon by mass and is suitable for use in photovoltaic manufacturing. The Solar Module is the connection and lamination of photovoltaic cells into an environmentally protected final assembly which is suitable to generate electricity when exposed to sunlight and ready for installation without an additional manufacturing process. The Solar Tracker is a mechanical system that moves solar modules according to the position of the sun and to increase energy output.
