department to address that.  The Department of Commerce Service gets a request for a job order contract and it's once again based on their budget and their needs.  So if the department feel that their budget only allows for, or their needs only allow for a two year agreement, then that's what they request.  If they feel that it needs more or less than they request that.  So it's really up to the department to determine when they requested that contract, their amount of duration.  Thank you, Mr.  Chair.  All right, and that's actually a perfect segue into first deputy Tom Carney from the Department of Transportation.  Hi.  Sorry about that.  Thank you, Chairman.  And thank you, members of the committee for having us here today.  Tom Carney, first deputy commissioner of CDOT.  I also have in attendance, Jazeal Cortez.  He's the head of our CDOT's contract section.  So the two contracts that you can see on the screen there, Ashlar Construction Company, that was awarded the JOC contract for flat work and site work.  CSI 3000 construction was awarded the JOC contract for structures.  So we had been engaged in the procurement process.  These were just awarded in October.  And in the subsequent recent months here, there were some bid protests filed by other firms that had to get properly reviewed and responded to.  Those responses just happened in recent weeks.  So now CDOT is gonna proceed with starting to issue task orders to these two contracts.  So in answer to Alderman Sawyer's question, we do not have any spend on these two contracts right now.  These are kind of like hot off the press.  So there is no spend, but there will be.  We certainly have work to assign out.  To give you some context of why CDOT uses JOC, JOC really is a tool for CDOT to fill in the gap areas that we cannot handle where we have a situation or project or location where the scope of the work or the situation of the work, we can't address it with our own CDOT in-house forces or maybe through one
