PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:

(emphasis added). For all these reasons, stare decisis cannot justify the new reasonable opportunity rule propounded by the concurrence. If that rule is to become the law of the land, it must stand on its own, but the concurrence makes no attempt to show that this rule represents a correct interpretation of the Constitution. The concurrence does not claim that the right to a reasonable opportunity to obtain an abortion is deeply rooted in this Nations history and tradition and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty. Glucksberg, 521 U. S., at 720721. Nor does it propound any other theory that could show that the Constitution supports its new rule. And if the Constitution protects a womans right to obtain an abortion, the opinion does not explain why that right should end after the point at which all reasonable women will have decided whether to seek an abortion. While the concurrence is moved by a desire for judicial minimalism, we cannot embrace a narrow ground of decision simply because it is narrow; it must also be right. Citizens United, 558 U. S., at 375 (ROBERTS, C. J., concurring). For the reasons that we have explained, the concurrences approach is not.  76 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court 3 The concurrence would leave for another day whether to reject any right to an abortion at all, post, at 7, but another day would not be long in coming. Some States have set deadlines for obtaining an abortion that are shorter than Mississippis. See, e.g., Memphis Center for Reproductive Health v. Slatery, 14 F. 4th, at 414 (considering law with bans at cascading intervals of two to three weeks beginning at six weeks), rehg en banc granted, 14 F. 4th 550 (CA6 2021). If we held only that Mississippis 15-week rule is constitutional, we would soon be called upon to pass on the constitutionality of a panoply of laws with shorter deadlines or no deadline at all. The measured course charted by the concurrence would be fraught with turmoil until the Court answered the question that the concurrence seeks to defer. Even if the Court ultimately adopted the new rule suggested by the concurrence, we would be faced with the difficult problem of spelling out what it means. For example, if the period required to give women a reasonable opportunity to obtain an abortion were pegged, as the concurrence seems to suggest, at the point when a certain percentage of women make that choice, see post, at 12, 910, we would have to identify the relevant percentage. It would also be necessary to explain what the concurrence means when it refers to rare circumstances that might justify an exception. Post, at 10. And if this new right aims to give women a reasonable opportunity to get an abortion, it would be necessary to decide whether factors other than promptness in deciding might have a bearing on whether such an opportunity was available. In sum, the concurrences quest for a middle way would only put off

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution does not protect a woman's right to an abortion after the point at which all reasonable women will have decided whether to seek one. This new rule, proposed by the concurrence, is not justified by stare decisis and would be fraught with turmoil if adopted.
