annually by the Secretary of Energy, and are to be adjusted for inflation beginning in 2025.  This section of the bill deals with the inflation adjustment and credit phase-out for the clean electricity production credit. The credit is adjusted for inflation each year, and begins to phase out for facilities whose construction begins during the second calendar year after the applicable year.  The "Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction for New and Existing Power Plants" rule, issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2015, requires power plants to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by a certain percentage below a baseline emissions rate. The rule applies to new, modified, and existing power plants and sets different targets for each category. For new power plants, the target is a greenhouse gas emission rate that is no more than 1,000 pounds of CO2e per megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity produced. For existing coal-fired power plants, the target is a reduction of at least 32 percent below the baseline emissions rate. The rule also requires power plants to meet an interim emissions reduction target of 30 percent below the baseline by 2030.  The section allows for qualified facilities to receive clean electricity production credits, provided that the electricity is produced within the United States. Additionally, any combined heat and power system property within the facility will also be taken into account for the purposes of determining the greenhouse gas emissions rate.  The credit for electricity production is apportioned among owners of the qualified facility in proportion to their ownership interests in the gross sales from the facility.
