Write an explanation of the following and how it is a waste of the City's money:


and i am with the planning construction department for northwestern happy to answer any questions thank you uh...  this also is supported by uh...  alderman sophia king okay questions from others committee no adult in maldon auto to the role uh...  also so welcome all the men are not committee member uh...  all the mccappelman just just a quick question i used to work at northwestern memorial hospital in their palliative care and i left that and later worked at university chicago medical center i'm noticing that this is just blocks away from university chicago medical center explain why they're so close together absolutely uh...  you know in looking at the demographics in the area our strategy and real estate team really identified a uh...  and under service in that community and you know you have seen fantastic and you know we inherently competitors we do like to partner with local uh...  health systems in chicago and i think that we have talked with them some about this and there is there's a big gap in care down there right now and we don't think that this will hinder any of their their services we think it's added for the community sta follow-up on that if i could ask uh...  is north western looking to do additional sites maybe not as big as this but uh...  smaller urgent cares elsewhere in chicago in the years ahead it's a very good question so um...  you know we're always looking to expand our footprint and to provide greater access to care you know uh...  we recognize that a lot of people do not necessarily want to come to streaterville it's a it's quite a journey for a lot and so what this building actually originally started out as an eighty thousand square foot building and through a pretty robust community engagement effort we've added uh...  to be that a hundred and twenty thousand square feet we added uh...  through that community feedback we added a pediatric practice ophthalmology practice a p t practice uh...  and also a multi-specialty uh...  clinic


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The city is spending money on a new Northwestern Memorial Hospital facility that is too close to the University of Chicago Medical Center. This is a waste of money because the two hospitals are competing with each other and there is already a gap in care in the area.
