397 U. S. 137, 142 (1970). The Casey undue burden standard is the same. It also resembles general standards that courts  34 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting work with daily in other legal sphereslike the rule of reason in antitrust law or the arbitrary and capricious standard for agency decisionmaking. See Standard Oil Co. of N. J. v. United States, 221 U. S. 1, 62 (1911); Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U. S. 29, 4243 (1983). Applying general standards to particular cases is, in many contexts, just what it means to do law. And the undue burden standard has given rise to no unusual difficulties. Of course, it has provoked some disagreement among judges. Casey knew it would: That much is to be expected in the application of any legal standard which must accommodate lifes complexity. 505 U. S., at 878 (plurality opinion). Which is to say: That much is to be expected in the application of any legal standard. But the majority vastly overstates the divisions among judges applying the standard. We count essentially two. THE CHIEF JUSTICE disagreed with other Justices in the June Medical majority about whether Casey called for weighing the benefits of an abortion regulation against its burdens. See 591 U. S., at ______ (slip op., at 67); ante, at 59, 60, and n. 53.10 We agree that the June Medical difference is a differencebut not one that would actually make a difference in the result of most cases (it did not in June Medical), and not one incapable of resolution were it ever to matter. As for lower courts, there is now a one-year-old, one-to-one Circuit split about how the undue burden standard applies to state laws that ban abortions for certain reasons, like fetal abnormality. See ante, at 61, and n. 57. That is about it, as far as we can see.11 And that is not much. This Court  10Some lower courts then differed over which opinion in June Medical was controllingbut that is a dispute not about the undue burden standard, but about the Marks rule, which tells courts how to determine the precedential effects of a divided decision. 11The rest of the majoritys supposed splits are, shall we say, unim-  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 35 BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting mostly does not even grant certiorari on one-year-old, oneto-one Circuit splits, because we know that a bit of disagreement is an inevitable part of our legal system. To borrow an old saying that might apply here: Not one or even a couple of swallows can make the majoritys summer. Anyone concerned about workability should consider the majoritys substitute standard. The majority says a law regulating or banning abortion must be sustained if there is a rational basis on which the legislature could have thought that it would serve legitimate state interests.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Casey undue burden standard is the same as the general standards that courts work with daily in other legal spheres. It is not unusual or difficult to apply, and has only provoked disagreement among judges on a few occasions. The majority's substitute standard, that a law regulating or banning abortion must be rational in order to serve legitimate state interests, is too broad and will lead to more disagreement and confusion.
