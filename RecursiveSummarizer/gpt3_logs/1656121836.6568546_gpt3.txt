See Brief for 547 Deans 910. We do not say that every State is Mississippi, and we are sure some have made gains since Roe and Casey in providing support for women and children. But a state-by-state analysis by public health professionals shows that States with the most restrictive abortion policies also continue to invest the least in womens and childrens health. See Brief for 547 Deans 2334. The only notable change we can see since Roe and Casey cuts in favor of adhering to precedent: It is that American abortion law has become more and more aligned with other nations. The majority, like the Mississippi Legislature, claims that the United States is an extreme outlier when it comes to abortion regulation. See ante, at 6, and n. 15. The global trend, however, has been toward increased provision of legal and safe abortion care. A number of countries, including New Zealand, the Netherlands, and Iceland, permit abortions up to a roughly similar time as Roe and Casey set.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The dissent argues that the majority's decision will harm women's health, especially in states with restrictive abortion policies. They point to data showing that carrying a pregnancy to term is much more dangerous than having an abortion, and that states with restrictive abortion policies tend to invest less in women's and children's health. They also argue that the global trend is toward increased access to legal and safe abortion care, and that the United States is now an outlier in its restrictions on abortion.
