PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


We have a quorum.  First item on the agenda is the approval of the March 22 rule 45 report for the Committee on Contract and Oversight and Equity.  No more with no objection Mr.  Chairman.  Thank you Alderman Austin.  Any questions? If not, Alderman Austin has a motion to pass.  All in favor? Aye.  Aye.  Aye.  None opposed.  I'll take that back off.  The motion passes.  Item number two is a proposed ordinance concerning an amendment of section 2-9, 2-3.30 of the municipal code of Chicago regarding enforcement of percentages of city resident participation of socioeconomically disadvantaged area work hours in construction contracts.  Is this a now question or is it a wait question? Chairman, I just wanted to, for you to make sure that there are no public participants at today's meeting.  Thank you, thank you Council.  I've not been informed of any public participation for this meeting.  No speakers are signed up timely in the manner that has been prescribed.  So thank you for that, Ruratu.  As I stated, our ordinance today for discussion, again, no vote will be taken for the city resident participation of socially economically disadvantaged area work hours in construction contracts.  So joining us today from the Department of Procurement is our chief procurement officer, Eileen Velasquez, as well as some members of the trade and other communities.  So first we're gonna have our CPO explain the ordinance and then we're gonna open up Q&A as well as hear from some of our industry members as well on this and then have additional Q&A.  And just so we can get some clarity and understanding.  I know this concept is different from what we normally do but we think it is something that will help enhance the lives of many Chicagoans.  And we want to do that as part of this work that we're doing to create a more equitable city here.  So we'll turn the floor over to- Mr.  Chairman Alderman Dowell, sorry I missed the roll call.  I just want to- I will mark you down.  Thank you.
