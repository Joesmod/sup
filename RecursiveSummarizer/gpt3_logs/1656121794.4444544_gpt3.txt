not involve same-sex marriage. 539 U. S., at 604. That could be true, he wrote, only if one entertains the belief that principle and logic have nothing to do with the decisions of this Court. Id., at 605. Score one for the dissent, as a matter of prophecy. And logic and principle are not one-way ratchets. Rights can contract in the same way and for the same reasonbecause whatever todays majority might say, one thing really does lead to another. We fervently hope that does not happen because of todays decision. We hope that we will not join Justice Scalia in the book of prophets. But we cannot understand how anyone can be confident that todays opinion will be the last of its kind. Consider, as our last word on this issue, contraception. The Constitution, of course, does not mention that word. And there is no historical right to contraception, of the kind the majority insists on. To the contrary, the American legal landscape in the decades after the Civil War was littered with bans on the sale of contraceptive devices. So again, there seem to be two choices. See supra, at 5, 2627. If the majority is serious about its historical approach, then Griswold and its progeny are in the line of fire too. Or if it is not serious, then . . . what is the basis of todays decision? If we had to guess, we suspect the prospects of this Court approving bans on contraception are low. But once again, the future significance of todays opinion will be decided in the future. At the least, todays opinion will fuel the fight to get contraception, and any other issues with a moral dimension, out of the Fourteenth Amendment and into state  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 29 BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting legislatures.9 Anyway, todays decision, taken on its own, is catastrophic enough. As a matter of constitutional method, the majoritys commitment to replicate in 2022 every view about the meaning of liberty held in 1868 has precious little to recommend it. Our law in this constitutional sphere, as in most, has for decades upon decades proceeded differently. It has considered fundamental constitutional principles, the whole course of the Nations history and traditions, and the step-by-step evolution of the Courts precedents. It is disciplined but not static. It relies on accumulated judgments, not just the sentiments of one long-ago generation of men (who themselves believed, and drafted the Constitution to reflect, that the world progresses). And by doing so, it includes those excluded from that olden conversation, rather than perpetuating its bounds. As a matter of constitutional substance, the majoritys opinion has all the flaws its method would suggest. Because laws in 1868 deprived women of any control over their bodies, the majority approves States doing so today. Because those laws prevented women from charting the course of their own lives, the majority says States can do the same again. Because in 1868, the government could tell a

CONCISE SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court has ruled that states can ban same-sex marriage. This decision overturns the 2015 ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, which had legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. The majority opinion, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, argues that the Constitution does not protect a right to same-sex marriage, and that this issue should be left to the states. Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan wrote a dissenting opinion, arguing that the majority's decision is "catastrophic" and that it will lead to further discrimination against LGBTQ people.
