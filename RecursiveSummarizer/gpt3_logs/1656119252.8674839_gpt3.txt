DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

In 1846, Michigan passed a law making it a felony to administer any medicine, drug, or substance to a pregnant woman with the intent to procure a miscarriage, unless the life of the mother was in danger or the two physicians advising the procedure believed it to be necessary. The punishment for this crime was up to 20 years in prison if the woman died as a result of the procedure, and up to seven years in prison if she survived. In Vermont, a similar law was passed in 1846 making it a felony to administer any poison, drug, medicine, or noxious thing to a pregnant woman with the intent to procure a miscarriage, unless the life of the mother was in danger or the two physicians advising the procedure believed it to be necessary. The punishment for this crime was up to 10 years in prison if the woman died as a result of the procedure, and up to one year in prison if she survived.
