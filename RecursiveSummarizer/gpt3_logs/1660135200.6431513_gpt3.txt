RESPONSE:

The "qualified commercial clean vehicle" tax credit is available for vehicles which meet certain energy efficiency requirements, are not manufactured for resale, and are used on public roads. The credit is similar to the credit available under section 30D of the tax code, but is not available for vehicles which are already eligible for that credit.
