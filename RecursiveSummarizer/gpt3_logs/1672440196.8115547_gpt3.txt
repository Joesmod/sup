move to reconsider the vote.  All those in favor of the motion for reconsideration signify by saying I all those opposed say nay.  The nays have it the motion for reconsideration defeated German way to spec to you.  I'm not sure if I'm going to go on the motion to reconsider the vote.  I'm not sure if I'm going to go on the motion to accommodate everyone.  And make sure everybody's able to speak to this if they wish.  But item 12 is a communication recommending the proposed ordinance regarding the authority to enter into and execute the designation.  Of the transit facility improvement area for the implementation of the red line extension project.  I'm going to go on the motion to reconsider the vote.  And I would like to open the floor for people to speak on this before I move passage by the role.  Before I move passage, the chair recognizes all the women now Austin.  Thank you, Madam President.  I'm a bill and myself and others have worked tirelessly for the red line extension.  Not for anything for us for self gratification.  But for the people that we represent on the far south side.  I've stood here many years and say that we are the city limits.  There's no place else to go but to Riverdale.  When you get out to the far south side, Blue Island and Elsa.  To hinder the individuals that we represent on the far south side from any opportunities that the north side the central side of Chicago is unfair.  Now that we have an opportunity to open the doors for those that live that far south.  When you talk about 134.  That's quite a distance that you have to take so many changes in order to get to your destination.  So I'm going to shortly limit my speech.  I don't want to run out of oxygen.  But to ask you, just consider those where now we have one less ward on the far south side, where I had to give up my ward because of the less numbers and people on the on the far south side.  But for you that have had years of opportunities.  Allow us to have those opportunities
