RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court of the United States is being asked to consider the case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey. The question before the Court is whether the Mississippi Gestational Age Act, which bans abortions after 15 weeks of gestation, violates the Constitution. The Act also requires that, after that point, abortions be performed in a manner that gives the unborn child the best chance of being born alive. The Supreme Court has previously recognized a constitutional right to abortion, but that right has been based on the premise that the fetus is not a "person" within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. If the fetus is a person, as the Mississippi legislature has found, then the State has a compelling interest in forbidding elective abortions after the point at which the unborn child is capable of feeling pain. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the Act, reasoning that if the fetus is a person, then the state has a compelling interest in protecting its life. The Supreme Court is now being asked to determine whether the Act violates the Constitution. The Supreme Court's decision in Casey threw out Roe v. Wade's trimester scheme and replaced it with a new rule under which states could not adopt any regulation that imposed an undue burden on a woman's right to have an abortion. The decision provided no clear guidance about the difference between a due and an undue burden. The three justices who authored the controlling opinion in Casey said that the Court's decision was the final settlement of the question of the constitutional right to abortion. However, in the years since Casey was decided, it has become increasingly apparent that the decision did not settle the issue of abortion. Americans continue to hold passionate and widely divergent views on abortion, and state legislatures have passed laws that are increasingly restrictive. In Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the Court applied rational basis review, under which a law is constitutional if there is a rational basis on which the legislature could have thought that it would serve legitimate state interests. The Court found that the Mississippi Legislature's specific findings, which include the State's asserted interest in "protecting the life of the unborn," provide a rational basis for the Gestational Age Act. Justices Thomas and Kavanaugh filed concurring opinions. Chief Justice Roberts filed an opinion concurring in the judgment. Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan filed a dissenting opinion. The Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of the Mississippi Gestational Age Act. However, based on its previous decisions and current trends, it is likely that the Court will find that the Act is constitutional.
