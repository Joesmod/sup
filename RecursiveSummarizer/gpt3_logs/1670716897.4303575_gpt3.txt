PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


with the city, advise the city on what works for the contracting community.  And have a really regular focused way to continue these discussions.  And finally, we suggested some additional program success metrics.  Of course, in addition to meeting the goals.  But it's also increasing prime bidding and the success rate from prime bidding by M.W.B.E.  We'd like to see increased subcontracting across more industries so less concentration of M.W.B.E.s.  And in our utilization and contract data chapter, there's a very lengthy analysis of concentration by industry subcodes there.  For those of you that are interested, so you can see what we mean about trying to broaden the base from which M.W.B.E.s work.  And finally, increasing the availability and the capacity of M.W.B.E.s to take on city projects, larger projects, more complex projects, more varied projects and more work as primes.  I think that's it.  Yes.  All right.  So I don't know if anyone has any questions for us, but I'd be happy to try to answer them.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I didn't see this down here.  It looks like three participants have raised their hands.  I'm not sure I can see.  I'm sorry.  I wasn't I wasn't unmuted.  This is.  Chairman David Moore, vice chair, David Moore, chairing this committee for Chairman Kerry Austin, who is not available at this time.  And before we go into question and answer session for a call on the next person.  What I would like to do, if I ask you a couple of questions and and so that you can elaborate on the increasing of the grocery seed, something that I know I've pushed others have pushed.  So explain to us, if you will, where we are now in terms of grocery seeds and what's your recommendation so I can hopefully fully understand that your recommendation change.  And if you can give some examples to that, that'd be helpful.  Yes, our recommendation is to take 150% of the gross receipts level that is established by by the SBA.  And of course there are hundreds and hundreds of
