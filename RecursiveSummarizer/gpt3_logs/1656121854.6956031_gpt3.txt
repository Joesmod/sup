The disruption of overturning Roe and Casey will therefore be profound. Abortion is a common medical procedure and a familiar experience in womens lives. About 18 percent of pregnancies in this country end in abortion, and about one quarter of American women will have an abortion before the age of 45.22 Those numbers reflect the predictable and life-changing effects of carrying a pregnancy, giving birth, and becoming a parent.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The majority opinion in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization lacks any discussion of how its ruling will affect women. This is despite the fact that the Court observed in Casey v. Planned Parenthood that individuals have organized their lives around the availability of abortion for over two decades. The majority's refusal to face the facts about how its ruling will impact women reveals a lack of understanding or concern for their lives and the suffering its decision will cause.
