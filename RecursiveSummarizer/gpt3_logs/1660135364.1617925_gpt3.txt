RESPONSE:

The Clean Air Act Amendments of 2018 establish emissions rates for facilities producing electricity, to be used for purposes of the tax credit for carbon capture and sequestration. The emissions rates are to be published annually by the Secretary of Energy, and are to be adjusted for inflation beginning in 2025.
