Write a concise summary of the following:

Obergefell explained, rights were defined by who exercised them in the past, then received practices could serve as their own continued justificationeven when they conflict with liberty and equality as later and more broadly understood. 576 U. S., at 671. The Constitution does not freeze for all time the original view of what those rights guarantee, or how they apply. That does not mean anything goes. The majority wishes people to think there are but two alternatives: (1) accept the original applications of the Fourteenth Amendment and no others, or (2) surrender to judges own ardent views, ungrounded in law, about the liberty that Americans should enjoy. Ante, at 14. At least, that idea is what the majority sometimes tries to convey. At other times, the majority (or, rather, most of it) tries to assure the public that it has no designs on rights (for example, to contraception) that arose only in the back half of the 20th centuryin other words,  4The majority ignores that rejection. See ante, at 5, 13, 36. But it is unequivocal: The Glucksberg test, Obergefell said, may have been appropriate in considering physician-assisted suicide, but is inconsistent with the approach this Court has used in discussing other fundamental rights, including marriage and intimacy. 576 U.

See ante, at 32, 66, 7172; ante, at 10 (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring); but see ante, at 3 (THOMAS, J., concurring). But that is a matter we discuss later. See infra, at 2429. For now, our point is different: It is that applications of liberty and equality can evolve while remaining grounded in constitutional principles, constitutional history, and constitutional precedents. The second Justice Harlan discussed how to strike the right balance when he explained why he would have invalidated a States ban on contraceptive use. Judges, he said, are not free to roam where unguided speculation might take them. Poe v. Ullman, 367 U. S. 497, 542 (1961) (dissenting opinion). Yet they also must recognize that the constitutional tradition of this country is not captured whole at a single moment. Ibid. Rather, its meaning gains content from the long sweep of our history and from successive judicial precedentseach looking to the last and each seeking to apply the Constitutions most fundamental commitments to new conditions. That is why Americans, to go back to Obergefells example, have a right to marry across racial lines. And it is why, to go back to Justice Harlans case, Americans have a right to use contraceptives so they can choose for themselves whether to have children. All that is what Casey understood. Casey explicitly rejected the present majoritys method. [T]he specific practices of States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, Casey stated, do not

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) held that the right to marry is a fundamental right guaranteed by the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court also held that states may not ban same-sex marriage or refuse to recognize valid marriages from other jurisdictions. In his dissent, Justice Breyer argues that the Court's ruling improperly expands the scope of the Fourteenth Amendment without any clear guidance on what other rights might be included. He also argues that the Court is effectively "picking and choosing" which rights to protect, based on individual preferences, rather than following a consistent constitutional principle.
