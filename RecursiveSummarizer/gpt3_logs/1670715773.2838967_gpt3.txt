resale store there.  We would not be in a position to take back the building.  If that makes sense.  I mean I don't want to get too technical but if they added something like that it would not be a problem.  I mean, if they decided, we're going to move it 10 blocks away, and we want to sell the building.  And after 10 years, there's no more covenant and they would be free to sell the building or do whatever they need to operationally without us being in a position to claw back the property.  Okay, that's, that was in the original agreement and this this agreement that we're signing off on today.  Yes, they, I mean, they will need to operate this as a clinic for the covenant or we would plot back.  Okay, that that's clear.  Thank you very much.  And there were a few other things in that original agreement that we passed that I think prohibits some other things like, you know, you can operate a parking lot and things like that so that would prevent them from really going to a private type of entity, I think as was mentioned, so thank you for that clarification Michael.  Thank you chairman.  That's you.  So Paul if you could provide that information again to Michael which will get it to the committee staff and we'll get it out to the members prior to the council vote.

RESPONSE:

The City Council is considering approving the sale of a city-owned property at 621 East 45th Street to More Love Word Church. The property would be sold under a covenant that would require the church to use it as a clinic for at least 10 years. If the church decides to sell the property after 10 years, the city would have the right to "claw back" the property.
