exists elsewhere in the code and we are just aligning just this section to to match that but I will turn it to right here to confirm.  Good morning good afternoon.  Good afternoon.  So on behalf of the city of Chicago's department of law.  This is a so lobbyists are already regulated by the code.  They have to cooperate when this list was originally put together in the legislation which had the part about appointed officer, employee, department agency, contractor, subcontractor.  All of that was looking at the legislative history.  It looked like it was a little bit at the last minute and it looks like the lobbyists were overlooked for this category.  This is a cleanup to make sure that the lobbyists understand that yes that they too are supposed to be cooperating.  Again by what authority? I mean because they're independent contractors are they they they are not a city employee correct? Correct.  Okay so under what authority does the city have to command them to cooperate? Since they already have to to register with the city and we have licenses with them that gives us the you have a license with them for for for for for lobbying.  Okay so they register like all lobbyists do and to let them know that they are conducting business that they are lobbying.  Yes.  Right.  So how can you compel them without subpoena or something to to do this? Are you are you saying that as by registering as a lobbyist with the city you agree to cooperate with the inspector general? I don't have the the the the the license before me I'd have I'd have to look at that.  Okay.  Moving on to the next page of Superintendent Chief Administrator Police Board.

What does that mean? Or is that a mistake? I'm sorry we're in section seven yes.  Yes shouldn't be yes.  So we've stricken as those


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The code already requires lobbyists to cooperate with investigations, and this is just a clarification that they are also included in the category of people who must cooperate. The city has the authority to compel lobbyists to cooperate because they are already registered with the city and have a license to lobby.
