CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

This section outlines the payments that may be made for energy efficiency upgrades carried out by individuals, building owners, and aggregators. For single family homes, the payment is either $2,000 per kilowatt hour saved or 50% of the project cost, whichever is less. For multifamily buildings, the payment is either $2,000 per dwelling unit or 50% of the project cost, whichever is less. For low- or moderate-income households, the payment is either $2,000 per kilowatt hour saved or 50% of the project cost, whichever is less.
