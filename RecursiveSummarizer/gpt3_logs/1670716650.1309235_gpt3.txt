all of this to bear.  I do believe that while it's not everything that everyone wants and we definitely want it to be more, we want the limits to be higher, we want the percentages to go up.  But we definitely thank Ms.  Hope for the work that she's done and laid out a path for us that not only is defensible but guaranteed, but gives us the best leverage possible to keep the program and keep growing these small minority and women owned businesses.  So just want to offer my support as well.  And if there aren't any other hands up, I would move that we pass this out of committee.  I ask that you hold that right now because there are some hands up, and I want to recognize our demand, Jeanette Taylor, who I see and add her to the role.  Right.  Next, I see, Alderman Cardenas.  Chairman, I just wanted to ask a question.  From a legal standpoint, where's the litigation, where does it stand right now in the courts.  I know that folks have been targeting this, this ordinance, and some of the programs and I wanted to hear about that and I was like supportive of the minority programs, the WWE in women's empowerment as well.  And so I'm just curious as to where that is.  Just keeping tabs on stuff.  Sure.  Thank you, Alderman.  I'm happy to answer that.  The most recent case involving a challenge to a local minority women business program was filed against Shelby County, Tennessee, which is Memphis.  I'm not going to stop and think about what Memphis has meant in the history of civil rights in this country and really is saying something.  But Shelby County was sued over their MWB program there were some concerns about their disparity study we did not do it.  Make sure I say that.  And the decision that the county made was to settle the case and drop their program.  And this was last November, I believe, maybe early December.  They are considering undertaking a new study, but they paid the plaintiffs over $300,000 in attorney's fees and agreed to spend the program completely
