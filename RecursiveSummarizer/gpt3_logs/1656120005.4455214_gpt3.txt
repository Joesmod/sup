PROMPT:

Write a detailed summary of the following:

Union Gas Co., 491 U. S. 1 (1989), seven years later; the decision in Union Gas never garnered a majority); Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528, 531 (1985) (holding that local governments are not constitutionally immune from federal employment laws, and overruling National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833 (1976), after “eight years” of experience under that regime showed Usery’s standard was unworkable and, in practice, undermined the federalism principles the decision sought  BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting 66 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION Appendix to opinion of BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ. to protect). The rest of the cited cases were relatively minor in their effect, modifying part or an application of a prior precedent’s test or analysis. See Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U. S. 778 (2009) (citing workability and practical concerns with additional layers of prophylactic procedural safeguards for defendants’ right to counsel, as had been enshrined in Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U. S. 625 (1986)); Illinois v. Gates, 462 U. S. 213, 227–228 (1983) (replacing a two-pronged test under Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U. S. 108 (1964), and Spinelli v. United States, 393 U. S. 410 (1969), in favor of a traditional totality-of-the-circumstances approach to evaluate probable cause for issuance of a warrant); Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U. S. 1, 4 (1964), and Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 202 (1962) (clarifying that the “political question” passage of the minority opinion in Colegrove v. Green, 328 U. S. 549 (1946), was not controlling law). In sum, none of the cases the majority cites is analogous to today’s decision to overrule 50- and 30-year-old watershed constitutional precedents that remain unweakened by any changes of law or fact.

DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

In Union Gas Co., the Supreme Court held that local governments are not constitutionally immune from federal employment laws. The decision overruled National League of Cities v. Usery, which had held that local governments are immune from federal laws regulating wages and hours. The Court in Union Gas reasoned that the Usery decision was unworkable and, in practice, undermined the federalism principles the decision sought to protect. In Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, the Court held that local governments are not constitutionally immune from federal employment laws. The decision overruled National League of Cities v. Usery, which had held that local governments are immune from federal laws regulating wages and hours. The Court in Garcia reasoned that the Usery decision was unworkable and, in practice, undermined the federalism principles the decision sought to protect. Today's decision to overrule 50- and 30-year-old watershed constitutional precedents that remain unweakened by any changes of law or fact is analogous to the decisions in Union Gas and Garcia.
