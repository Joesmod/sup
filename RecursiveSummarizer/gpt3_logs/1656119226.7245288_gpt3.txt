The Mississippi Legislature’s findings recount the stages of “human prenatal development” and assert the State’s interest in “protecting the life of the unborn.” §2(b)(i). The legislature also found that abortions performed after 15 weeks typically use the dilation and evacuation procedure, and the legislature found the use of this procedure “for nontherapeutic or elective reasons [to be] a barbaric practice, dangerous for the maternal patient, and demeaning to the medical profession.” §2(b)(i)(8); see also Gonzales, 550 U.

DETAILED SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

In 1868, Missouri, Illinois, and New York had laws criminalizing abortion at all stages of pregnancy. These laws were designed to protect the life of the unborn and to prevent the barbaric practice of dilation and evacuation abortions. The Supreme Court has now overturned Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood, returning the authority to regulate or prohibit abortion to the people and their elected representatives.
