PROMPT:

Write an itemized summary of any proposed spending, starting with the amount proposed to spend and what that money spent will do in the following:


it's kind of way out of market.  Thank you.  Well, I think with this one, the applicant, with all the ad labs, what they can do once they buy the property is just combine the property as long as they can buy it at one pin so they can put the properties together so that that does, I believe, add the value to their property up to the amount of what they're getting the property in my professional opinion.  That's not my point.  You're missing my point, but that's fine.  So, the committee has been joined by Alderman Sophia King and Alderman David Moore.  Are there other questions from members of the committee? Thank you.  Chairman Mike Rodriguez checking in as well.  Also adding Alderman Rodriguez to the role.  Alderman Silverstein and Alderman Mitts are joining us today as guests to the committee, so we're glad that they're here.  So, can I get a motion to recommend approval of this item by the affirmative vote of all members present for the roll call term form? So moved, Alderman Haddon.  So moved, hearing no objection, so ordered.  Doo-pax recommendation to this ordinance will be reported at the next City Council meeting on Wednesday, September 21st.  Item number two is the sale of vacant city-owned property at 4350 West Van Buren Street to Nagaya T.  Burner, the adjacent neighbor at 4348 South Van Buren Avenue.  The property is zoned Rt4 in the West Garfield Park Community Area.  The property will be used on the area.  The appraised market value is $6,000 and the sale price is $1,000.  The vacant lot dimensions is 25 by 125 or 3125 square feet approximately.  In addition, the department has obtained the as clearance on the parcel.  We have support from 28 board Alderman Jason Irvin.  That concludes my presentation.  Thank you.  Other questions from members of the committee? Seeing no questions, can I get a do pass recommendation of this ordinance that will be reported? I'm sorry, do pass recommendation of this ordinance by the affirmative vote of all members
