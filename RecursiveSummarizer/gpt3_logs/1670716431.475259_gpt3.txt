Write a concise summary of the following:


  My name is Patricia Davis.  I am with Unique Case Work Installation.  And my gripes in regards to the CHA job program.  Now, I've made notes so I don't take too long.  In my opinion, it was a mistake to do away with the job program because it took away the ability for so many black contractors to put food on the table, pay rent, and close their families.  And the most heart-wrenching for me was it took away the pride from so many black men that were able to prove to their community that we can own businesses, be successful, and was the go-to person in the community when help was needed.  And some might feel that this was a charity.  This was not a charity because the CHA and their team made sure if you were up north on Clyburn, downtown on Tinsbury, or on the west side or Inglewood, the quality of your work was fit for a king.  I would say this.  There is no way I could run this city as mayor of state as governor.  But when our leaders make a decision and a vast majority has been disenfranchised, I think they should do everything in their power to make it right.  There are so many affordable housing opportunities coming to North Lawndale.  But we won't be able to participate because our livelihood has been sticking away.  Now, the CHA Yaw Program, as it stands, is way off from what it was.  When the current leaders were there and you all could check the records later on, everyone was starving, blacks, whites, Hispanics.  But right now, in my eyesight, I see whites, Hispanics, Polish, every nationality is thriving.  And they are thriving in our community.  There is no way that we could go to Naperville, any of those towns, and work in large numbers of black people while white men, Polish men, Hispanic men, laying on the couch watching TV.  And so I say to the mayor and say to all the Alderman's that's on this call that this CHA Yaw Program needs to be reinstated as it was.  Because we are sick of begging.  You got the related Ms.  West, the Surland Bay, all these
