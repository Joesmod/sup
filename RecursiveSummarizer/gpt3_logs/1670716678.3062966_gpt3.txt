the government to make that happen, we should do that.  I guess my second question is, do the standards that you are the recommendations that you come up with apply to suppliers on construction projects.  Yes, if they are certified in one of the construction codes, this may be a little more than you really wanted to hear but the city certifies under what are called NAICS codes North American Industry Classification System codes.  They are developed by the US Census Bureau.  And so they may not follow necessarily what people think of in their minds or how they would think industry works.  So if a firm is certified in a NAICS code for construction, yes, then they do what they would apply because you may, of course, as I know, you know, the city really has two programs as the result of being sued by the Builders Association all those years ago.  So there's the construction ordinance, which is before you today.  And then there's the non construction ordinance.  If you're a firm certified under the construction ordinance, then yes, these changes apply to you.  If you are firm certified outside the construction ordinance, then these changes don't apply to you.  But note that the non construction standards are very different and, you know, firms are able to stay in those programs a little bit longer, I think.  Monica said, is that an accurate or fair summary? Yes.  Yes.  All right.  Very well.  Thank you very much, Mr.  Chair.  Thank you, Alderman Dow.  Before I come back to you, Alderman Cam, go to Alderman Jeanette Taylor.  All right.  I see your hand but I cannot hear you.  We'll go back to Alderman Sophia Cain.  I just piggybacking off of Chairman Dow's question and I appreciate you, you know, recommending that there's more staff, I think, that that's spot on, but I think in your recommendation, you also mentioned another department.  Can you speak on that or is that just kind of acknowledging we need more, you know, human beings working on this? Well, there are

RESPONSE:

The city of Chicago is currently sued by the Builders Association, and as a result, has two programs in place - the construction ordinance and the non construction ordinance. If a firm is certified under the construction ordinance, then the changes proposed in this ordinance apply to them. If a firm is certified outside the construction ordinance, then the changes don't apply to them.
