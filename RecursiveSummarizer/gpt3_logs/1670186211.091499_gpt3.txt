Write a concise summary of the following:


internal and external engagement and I fully expect that you know everyone in this office will be briefing Council regularly.  So that is the intention.  Thank you so no.  So now, next question so this is a separate office.  Yes, it is.  Is this a position, especially the sustainability officers in an appointed position, it said, is it just a management position that it just an appointed position by the mayor, you know approved by city council, and then you know, because it's a department when we come back for budget hearings, they will come before the council.  This is not clear in other questions so I'm just clarifying it so that it is an appointed position, and then this council will then vote on up or down on this position.  Yes, and you know this, this department slash office, you know, it's given a department number it will be its own page, and it will come before Council budget hearing time like every other department in our book, but so why not just call it office of the environment.  What's what's wrong with that.  So we're starting with this office, I think you know a lot of the work, and I know a lot of the conversation I've had with many of us is that we're leading to a more robust department, it's starting with this 10 person office.  I think by the time we get to the 2024 budget recommendation.  The goal of what we said in the management ordinance is that we will come before Council with the results of the study, and what a robust department, which is what we'll move into with non personnel lines and you know everything that goes into a full department, and all the different pieces that I know everyone's been talking about.  And that's where we hope to get to for 2024.  Again, I really I think that should be office of maybe environmental protection and then inequity, maybe that that the port environmental council on top of the first letter.  It makes more sense to me.  Point of information on them and Garza.  So did I hear you say that this year if


CONCISE SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

The city council is discussing the formation of a new department, the Office of the Environment. This office will be responsible for internal and external engagement, and will be overseen by a sustainability officer. The council is still discussing the budget for this office, but the goal is to have a full department in place by 2024.
