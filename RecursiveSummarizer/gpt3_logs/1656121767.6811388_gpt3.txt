Write a concise summary of the following:

v. Botsford, 141 U. S. 250, 251 (1891); see Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U. S. 261, 269 (1990) (Every adult has a right to determine what shall be done with his own body). Or to put it more simply: Everyone, including women, owns their own bodies. So the Court has restricted the power of government to interfere with a persons medical decisions or compel her to undergo medical procedures or treatments. See, e.g., Winston v. Lee, 470 U. S. 753, 766767 (1985) (forced surgery); Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165, 166, 173174 (1952) (forced stomach pumping); Washington v. Harper, 494 U. S. 210, 229, 236 (1990) (forced administration of antipsychotic drugs). Casey recognized the doctrinal affinity between those precedents and Roe. 505 U. S., at 857. And that doctrinal affinity is born of a factual likeness. There are few greater incursions on a body than forcing a woman to complete a pregnancy and give birth. For every woman, those experiences involve all manner of physical changes, medical treatments (including the possibility of a cesarean section), and   22 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting medical risk. Just as one example, an American woman is 14 times more likely to die by carrying a pregnancy to term than by having an abortion. See Whole Womans Health v. Hellerstedt, 579 U. S. 582, 618 (2016). That women happily undergo those burdens and hazards of their own accord does not lessen how far a State impinges on a womans body when it compels her to bring a pregnancy to term. And for some women, as Roe recognized, abortions are medically necessary to prevent harm. See 410 U. S., at 153. The majority does not saywhich is itself ominouswhether a State may prevent a woman from obtaining an abortion when she and her doctor have determined it is a needed medical treatment.  So too, Roe and Casey fit neatly into a long line of decisions protecting from government intrusion a wealth of private choices about family matters, child rearing, intimate relationships, and procreation. See Casey, 505 U. S., at 851, 857; Roe, 410 U. S., at 152153; see also ante, at 3132 (listing the myriad decisions of this kind that Casey relied on). Those cases safeguard particular choices about whom to marry; whom to have sex with; what family members to live with; how to raise childrenand crucially, whether and when to have children. In varied cases, the Court explained that those choicesthe most intimate and personal a person can makereflect fundamental aspects of personal identity; they define the very attributes of personhood. Casey, 505 U. S., at 851. And they inevitably shape the nature and future course of a persons life (and often the lives of those closest to her). So, the Court held, those choices belong to the individual, and not the government. That is the essence of what liberty requires. And liberty may require it, this Court has repeatedly said, even when those living in

RESPONSE:

The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that every adult has the right to determine what shall be done with their own body, including medical decisions or procedures. This right extends to women, who have the right to choose whether or not to have an abortion.
