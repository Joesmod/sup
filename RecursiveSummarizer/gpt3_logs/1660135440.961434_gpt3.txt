The Environmental Justice Capacity Limitation Credit is a credit that may be applied to the annual capacity limitation for calendar year 2025 for any property that is placed in service after the date that is four years after the date of the allocation with respect to the facility of which such property is a part. If any amount of environmental justice capacity limitation expires during any calendar year, it shall be taken into account as an excess for such calendar year, subject to the limitation imposed by the last sentence of such subparagraph. The Secretary shall, by regulations or other guidance, provide for recapturing the benefit of any increase in the credit allowed under subsection (a) by reason of this subsection with respect to any property which ceases to be property eligible for such increase (but which does not cease to be investment credit property within the meaning of section 50(a)).
