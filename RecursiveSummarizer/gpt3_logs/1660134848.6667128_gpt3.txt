RESPONSE:

This section allows enrollees in a prescription drug plan or an MA plan to elect to pay their cost-sharing in monthly installments, capped at a maximum monthly amount. The maximum monthly amount is determined by the PDP sponsor or MA organization, and is based on the enrollee's annual out-of-pocket costs.
