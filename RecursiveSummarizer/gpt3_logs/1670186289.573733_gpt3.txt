CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The aldermen are discussing the mayor's salary, which has not been increased since 2024. They are considering an adjustment to the CPI (Consumer Price Index) which would increase the mayor's salary. However, Alderman Tony is opposed to this idea. The board takes a five minute break to discuss the matter further.
