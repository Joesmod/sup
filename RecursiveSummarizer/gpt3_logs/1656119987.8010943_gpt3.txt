DETAILED SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

In the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the Supreme Court ruled that all-white primaries are unconstitutional. This case overturns the previous decision in Grovey v. Townsend, which had held that all-white primaries did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court reasoned that the unitary character of the electoral process, as recognized in United States v. Classic, required that all-white primaries be struck down. In addition, the Court overruled Darby v. United States, which had held that the Commerce Clause did not give Congress the power to regulate employment conditions. The Court reasoned that the intervening decision in Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins had made clear the fallacy underlying the Darby decision. Finally, the Court partially overruled Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, holding that the First Amendment does not protect campaign-related speech to the same extent as other speech.
