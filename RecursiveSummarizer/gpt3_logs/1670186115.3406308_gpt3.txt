Write a concise summary of the following:


for election day.  Part of that precinct consolidation has allowed us to overstaff our election judges.  Currently we are $1,500 over our target, which is great.  We are preparing for resignations and other attrition leading up the next few days.

I just think a lot of people who already have their card or know what they're doing, they just not even open it.  And then they realize that, oh, my God, we have a new, for the first time in many, many years, I got a new polling place.  And some of these buildings, as you know, are in high rises that have, in some cases, voting in their building.  They are not happy.  I already know the people that seem to know that it's been changed.  So we're going to have a real, we're going to
