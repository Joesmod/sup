RESPONSE:

In 1866, the state of Nebraska passed a law making it a crime to "knowingly sell, or cause to be sold any poison, drug, mixture, preparation, medicine or noxious thing, or any instrument or means whatever; for the purpose of producing abortion, or . . . where any advice, direction, information or knowledge may be obtained for the purpose of causing the miscarriage or abortion of any woman pregnant with child." The law also made it a crime to "knowingly sell or cause to be sold any medicine, or who shall knowingly use or cause to be used any means whatsoever for that purpose." In 1873, the law was expanded to include other methods of abortion. In 1868, the state of Florida passed a law making it a crime to "administer to any woman pregnant with a quick child any medicine, drug, or substance whatever, or shall use or employ any instrument, or other means, with intent thereby to destroy such child," unless the abortion was necessary to save the life of the mother. The law also made it a crime to "unlawfully administer to her, or advises, or prescribes for her, or causes to be taken by her, any poison, drug, medicine, or other noxious thing, or unlawfully uses any instrument or other means with the like intent" in order to procure a miscarriage.
