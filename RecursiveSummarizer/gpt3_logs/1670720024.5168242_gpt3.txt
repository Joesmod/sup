design the website because it would violate their right to free speech. The second lawyer argues that the designer does not have a right to free speech in this case because they are refusing to serve an entire class of people.  The conversation is about whether or not someone who designs websites can refuse to sell a website to a same-sex couple. The person arguing that they should be able to refuse says that it's different than just selling a product, because the website is customized for each couple.  The artist would not be able to object if the song were used at a same-sex wedding, as it would be in the "stream of commerce."  The artist in this case is a freelancer who provides customized services to anyone who pays her. However, she refuses to provide services to people whose messages she disagrees with.

However, the other side argues that since the websites are just a product and not actually expressive, the artist should not be required to sell them to everyone.
