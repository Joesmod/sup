Write a detailed summary of the following:

dissent argues that if the majority is correct in its legal analysis, then all of these other rights are also properly left to the states. The dissent also argues that the majority opinion provides no way to distinguish between the right to choose an abortion and a range of other rights.  In 1868, the US Constitution was amended to include the Fourteenth Amendment, which guarantees equal protection under the law. Today, the Supreme Court has ruled that this Amendment does not protect the right to same-sex marriage, overturning the 2015 decision that legalized gay marriage nationwide. In doing so, the Court has effectively given individual states the power to ban same-sex marriage if they so choose. The majority opinion, written by Justice Scalia, argues that there is no historical right to same-sex marriage, and that the Constitution does not protect such a right. He also argues that the 2015 decision was wrongly decided, and that today's ruling will correct that error. The dissent, written by Justice Breyer, argues that the majority opinion is based on a false understanding of history and constitutional law. He also argues that the majority's decision will have far-reaching negative consequences, including opening the door to bans on contraception and other morally-loaded issues.  The U.S. Supreme Court has overturned the Roe v. Wade decision, which has protected a woman's right to abortion for the past 50 years. In a close 5-4 decision, the Court ruled that states can now ban abortion entirely, or place restrictions on it that make it effectively impossible to obtain. This decision will have a profound impact on the lives of women across the country, as well as on the reproductive rights movement more broadly. The majority opinion, written by Chief Justice John Roberts, argued that the Roe decision was wrongly decided and that the Constitution does not protect a woman's right to abortion. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, wrote a concurring opinion that argued that the Roe decision was "an erroneous decision" and that the Court should not have been hesitant to overturn it. The dissenting opinion, written by Justice Stephen Breyer and joined by Justice Elena Kagan, argued that the Roe decision was correctly decided and that the Court should not have overturned it. The dissenters argued that the majority opinion will have a harmful impact on women's lives and that it flies in the face of the Court's precedent on reproductive rights.  The Court must have a good reason to overrule a precedent, and simply believing that the precedent was wrongly decided is not enough. The majority today lists some 30 of our cases as overruling precedent, and argues that they support overruling Roe and Casey. But none does, as further described below and in the Appendix. In some, the Court only partially modified or clarified a precedent. And in the rest, the Court relied on one or more of the traditional stare decisis factors in
