PROMPT:

Write an explanation of the following and how it is a waste of the City's money:


was to facilitate permanent housing.  And so we built permanent rentals.  And so to be able to bridge and start working with CDPH and DFSS more of as a service department, how do I help you facilitate your needs, get you the buildings that you want? That's the direction we've been moving.  So in addition to kind of standing up SROs and taking some ownership as that's a piece of housing and affordability and homelessness, it's also more actively working with those departments to now, for example, doing the non-congregate hotel acquisitions.  So we did an RFP in October that just closed and we're about to notice those people I think today, those that were able to help acquire new spaces for non-congregate shelter.  And based on the budget that we have, I anticipate going to contract on potentially two or three of those this year.  And so people can be into them shortly into the spring.  That's really brilliant.  Thank you very much for sharing.  Thank you for the report, Chair, that is everything for me.  Oleg Mancisco Lopez.  Thank you, Chairman.  And thank you, Brian, for being here with the report.  I wanted to touch, I mean, I know that there's an effort to preserve SROs that see that the portfolio, a little over 2,800 units.  Just yesterday we had a whole coalition of leaders who were talking about the need to address homelessness, you know, and making sure that we put forward a plan.  What I see in the report is approximately $207 million for approximately 2,800 units, right, just more or less.  That's a cost for the city, maybe about 80,000 per unit preserve or to create, right, more or less in terms of what we have right now.  One of the things that we are concerned is with the, you know, the dimension of the housing crisis, right? 2,800, 3,000 is really a drop in the bucket given the need.  My question is on looking at the assets that the city has, right, in terms of empty facilities, right, public schools, and again, maybe even partnerships as we discuss,


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The city is spending $207 million to preserve 2,800 SRO units, which is a drop in the bucket compared to the need for affordable housing. The city should be looking at empty public facilities and partnering with private developers to create more affordable housing.
