Amendments Due Process Clause. 505 U. S., at 846. The controlling opinion criticized and rejected Roes trimester scheme, 505 U. S., at 872, and substituted a new and obscure undue burden test. Casey, in short, either refused to reaffirm or rejected important aspects of Roes analysis, failed to remedy glaring deficiencies in Roes reasoning, endorsed what it termed Roes central holding while suggesting that a majority might not have thought it was correct, provided no new support for the abortion right other than Roes status as precedent, and imposed a new test with no firm grounding in constitutional text, history, or precedent. Pp. 4556. (3) Workability. Deciding whether a precedent should be overruled depends in part on whether the rule it imposes is workablethat is, whether it can be understood and applied in a consistent and predictable manner. Caseys undue burden test has scored poorly on the workability scale. The Casey plurality tried to put meaning into the undue burden test by setting out three subsidiary rules, but these rules created their own problems. And the difficulty of applying Caseys new rules surfaced in that very case. Compare 505 U. S., at 881 887, with id., at 920922 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The experience of the Courts of Appeals provides further evidence that Caseys line between permissible and unconstitutional restrictions has proved to be impossible to draw with precision.

Continued adherence to Caseys unworkable undue burden test would undermine, not advance, the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles. Payne, 501 U. S., at 827. Pp. 5662. (4) Effect on other areas of law. Roe and Casey have led to the distortion of many important but unrelated legal doctrines, and that effect provides further support for overruling those decisions. See Ramos v. Louisiana, 590 U.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The controlling opinion in the case of Casey v. Planned Parenthood criticized and rejected Roe v. Wade's trimester scheme, and substituted a new and obscure "undue burden" test. This new test has proved to be unworkable, leading to a long list of Circuit conflicts. Additionally, Roe and Casey have led to the distortion of many important but unrelated legal doctrines. Finally, traditional reliance interests are not implicated by an overturn of Roe and Casey because getting an abortion is generally unplanned activity.
