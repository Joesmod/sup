PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


includes restrictions upon persons and businesses who want to do business with the city and have been convicted of the new edition of hate crimes or treason sedition or related offenses.  So that's the language of this is added in the substitute change.  So, that's the question.  It is there a section I'm sorry I'm just looking at it that says something about an eligibility due to removal from office and I was really due to admission get those have underlined so I assume those are new and I was really due to filing of charges, or can you speak to those as well.  Great so the municipal code includes an eligibility to do business with the city.  We have an eligibility to do business with the city, and we have an eligibility to do business with the city.  We have an eligibility to do business with the city.  Give me one second I'm sorry I'm just reading so everything that's underlined is new.  Obviously, right.  Correct.  Yes, ma'am.  One quick question.  I'm sure was new to the substitute or new to the ordinance itself so there were forces that are new as part of the ordinance from the change in the current municipal code, which are also underline as well so just so that there's clarity everything that's underlined is not new to the substitute.  Correct the, the, the, everything that is underlined was part of the original ordinance introduced what's new is the addition of hate crimes.  And so, all that language is all new, because that is the new substitute.  And then the king.  I will, I'm gonna look as his hand up so I will go to all the low passing and come back to you after.  After his question.  Thank you.  Thank you chairman and I wish to thank all around Vegas and Riley for this, and thank the mayor's office for including a crime, a crime as well as being an ineligibility to do business with the city.  You don't need to do business with the city of Chicago.  If you don't love this country, you don't love the people that make up this country the city should not
