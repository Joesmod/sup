pregnancy. Second, as we will show, during the relevant periodi.e., the period surrounding the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendmentthe quickening distinction was abandoned as States criminalized abortion at all stages of pregnancy. See infra, at 21  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 17 Opinion of the Court The eminent common-law authorities (Blackstone, Coke, Hale, and the like), Kahler v. Kansas, 589 U. S. ___, ___ (2020) (slip op., at 7), all describe abortion after quickening as criminal. Henry de Bractons 13th-century treatise explained that if a person has struck a pregnant woman, or has given her poison, whereby he has caused abortion, if the foetus be already formed and animated, and particularly if it be animated, he commits homicide. 2 De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae 279 (T. Twiss ed. 1879); see also 1 Fleta, c. 23, reprinted in 72 Selden Soc. 60 61 (H. Richardson & G. Sayles eds. 1955) (13th-century treatise).25 Sir Edward Cokes 17th-century treatise likewise asserted that abortion of a quick child was murder if the childe be born alive and a great misprision if the childe dieth in her body. 3 Institutes of the Laws of England 50 51 (1644). (Misprision referred to some heynous offence under the degree of felony. Id., at 139.) Two treatises by Sir Matthew Hale likewise described abortion of a quick child who died in the womb as a great crime and a great misprision. Pleas of the Crown 53 (P. Glazebrook ed. 1972); 1 History of the Pleas of the Crown 433 (1736) (Hale). And writing near the time of the adoption of our Constitution, William Blackstone explained that abortion of a quick child was by the ancient law homicide or manslaughter (citing Bracton), and at least a very heinous misdemeanor (citing Coke). 1 Commentaries on the Laws of England 129130 (7th ed. 1775) (Blackstone). English cases dating all the way back to the 13th century corroborate the treatises statements that abortion was a crime. See generally J. Dellapenna, Dispelling the Myths  25. 25Even before Bractons time, English law imposed punishment for the killing of a fetus. See Leges Henrici Primi 222223 (L. Downer ed. 1972) (imposing penalty for any abortion and treating a woman who aborted a quick child as if she were a murderess).  18 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court of Abortion History 126, and n. 16, 134142, 188194, and nn. 8486 (2006) (Dellapenna); J. Keown, Abortion, Doctors and the Law 312 (1988) (Keown). In 1732, for example, Eleanor Beare was convicted of destroying the Foetus in the Womb of another woman and thereby causing her to miscarry.26 For that crime and another misdemeanor, Beare was sentenced to two days in the pillory and three years imprisonment.27 Although a pre-quickening abortion was not itself considered homicide, it does not follow that abortion was permissible at common lawmuch less that abortion was a legal right.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The English common law treated abortion as a crime, regardless of whether the fetus was quickened (i.e., when it first showed signs of life). This remained the case in America up until the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment.
