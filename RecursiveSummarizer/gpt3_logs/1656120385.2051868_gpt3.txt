Write a detailed summary of the following:

S. 549. In Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, the Court ruled that right to counsel for indigent defendant in a criminal prosecution in state court under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. This overruled Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S. 455. In Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, the Court ruled that federal courts have jurisdiction to consider constitutional challenges to state redistricting plans. This effectively overruled in part Colegrove, 328 U. S. 549.  The Supreme Court of the United States ruled in the case of Janus v. State, County, and Municipal Employees that the exclusionary rule applies to the States. The Court also ruled that the rule regarding the inadmissibility of evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment applies to the States. In the case of Plessy v. Ferguson, the Court ruled that racial restrictions on the right to vote in primary elections violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In the case of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, the Court ruled that Congress does not have the power to declare substantive rules of common law; a federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction must apply the substantive state law. In each of these cases, the Court overruled a previous decision. In each case, the Court found that the previous decision was egregiously wrong and deeply damaging. The Court in the case of Janus found that the exclusionary rule applies to the States. The rule had been established in the case of Mapp v. Ohio, which held that the rule regarding the inadmissibility of evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment applies to the States. The Court in Janus found that the rule in Mapp was "egregiously wrong" and "deeply damaging." The Court in Plessy found that racial restrictions on the right to vote in primary elections violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court in Plessy found that the decision in Grovey v. Townsend, which had upheld such restrictions, was "egregiously wrong" and "deeply damaging." The Court in Erie found that Congress does not have the power to declare substantive rules of common law; a federal court sitting in diversity jurisdiction must apply the substantive state law. The Court in Erie found that the decision in Swift v. Tyson, which had held that Congress does have the power to declare substantive rules of common law, was "egregiously wrong" and "deeply damaging."  In Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court found that the Constitution implicitly conferred a right to obtain an abortion. However, this decision was based on weak grounds, as it failed to ground its decision in text, history, or precedent. It relied on an erroneous historical narrative, and it devoted great attention to matters that have no bearing on the meaning of the Constitution. In Casey v. Planned Parenthood, the Court attempted to resolve the national controversy surrounding abortion by declaring a winning side. However, in doing so, the Court short-circuited the democratic

DETAILED SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court of the United States has a long history of overturning its own precedent when it believes that the previous decision was egregiously wrong. In the case of Gideon v. Wainwright, the Court overturned its previous decision in Betts v. Brady and ruled that indigent defendants have a right to counsel in criminal prosecutions in state court. In Baker v. Carr, the Court overturned its previous decision in Colegrove v. Carpenter and ruled that federal courts have jurisdiction to hear constitutional challenges to state redistricting plans. In the most recent case of Janus v. State, County, and Municipal Employees, the Court again overturned its own precedent, this time finding that the exclusionary rule applies to the States. The Court also ruled that the rule regarding the inadmissibility of evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment applies to the States. In both cases, the Court found that the previous decision was egregiously wrong and deeply damaging. In Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court found that the Constitution implicitly conferred a right to obtain an abortion. However, this decision was based on weak grounds, as it failed to ground its decision in text, history, or precedent. It relied on an erroneous historical narrative, and it devoted great attention to matters that have no bearing on the meaning of the Constitution. In Casey v. Planned Parenthood, the Court attempted to resolve the national controversy surrounding abortion by declaring a winning side. However, in doing so, the Court short-circuited the democratic process and left the issue unresolved.
