Write a concise summary of the following:

constitutional right of personal privacy, id., at 152, but it conflated two very different meanings of the term: the right Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 49 Opinion of the Court to shield information from disclosure and the right to make and implement important personal decisions without governmental interference. See Whalen v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 599600 (1977). Only the cases involving this second sense of the term could have any possible relevance to the abortion issue, and some of the cases in that category involved personal decisions that were obviously very, very far afield. See Pierce, 268 U. S. 510 (right to send children to religious school); Meyer, 262 U. S. 390 (right to have children receive German language instruction). What remained was a handful of cases having something to do with marriage, Loving, 388 U. S. 1 (right to marry a person of a different race), or procreation, Skinner, 316 U. S. 535 (right not to be sterilized); Griswold, 381 U. S. 479 (right of married persons to obtain contraceptives); Eisenstadt, 405 U. S. 438 (same, for unmarried persons). But none of these decisions involved what is distinctive about abortion: its effect on what Roe termed potential life. When the Court summarized the basis for the scheme it imposed on the country, it asserted that its rules were consistent with the following: (1) the relative weights of the respective interests involved, (2) the lessons and examples of medical and legal history, (3) the lenity of the common law, and (4) the demands of the profound problems of the present day. Roe, 410 U. S., at 165. Put aside the second and third factors, which were based on the Courts flawed account of history, and what remains are precisely the sort of considerations that legislative bodies often take into account when they draw lines that accommodate competing interests. The scheme Roe produced looked like legislation, and the Court provided the sort of explanation that might be expected from a legislative body. c What Roe did not provide was any cogent justification for the lines it drew. Why, for example, does a State have no    50 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court authority to regulate first trimester abortions for the purpose of protecting a womans health? The Courts only explanation was that mortality rates for abortion at that stage were lower than the mortality rates for childbirth. Id., at 163. But the Court did not explain why mortality rates were the only factor that a State could legitimately consider. Many health and safety regulations aim to avoid adverse health consequences short of death. And the Court did not explain why it departed from the normal rule that courts defer to the judgments of legislatures in areas fraught with medical and scientific uncertainties. Marshall v. United States, 414 U. S. 417, 427 (1974). An even more glaring deficiency was Roes failure to justify the critical distinction it drew between pre- and

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The U.S. Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision created a legal framework for abortion that has been widely criticized for its lack of a clear justification for the lines it drew between pre- and post-viability abortions. In particular, the Court's decision has been criticized for its reliance on mortality rates as the sole factor in determining whether a state can regulate first trimester abortions.
