my issue is with the average resident that might have a two flat that they are renting out that unit to a student whose semester is only seven months or i'm here to i'm visiting i'm doing a summer school program i'm here for three months that would be considered short term rental and would they have to provide the fee and and all it does is all i'm asking is that because as it stands now they would be included and i may because they're they're international students i use the university of chicago for example for example um they they may advertise this but we we are not a a big company so i i want residents i want there to be some consideration for the single person that is not in the business like these others for just one unit or two units that would just be the the usual 125 registration fee per that individual unit why do they why do they because we brought in because remember remember a couple years ago the individual unit owners only registered with the companies and back then we we it was just chaos we didn't know the companies were now reporting to the city of chicago so we as a department brought in all of the various individual registrations from all the various platforms for instance airbnb when they register with us bacp that host the actual property owner the renter pays us 125 and they can do whatever they want the rest of the year in terms of uh licensing it out to their customers you you're still not i'm it it seems to me that the answer is that if you are not affiliated with a platform this does not apply okay that's right correct correct i'm just i'm just trying to protect the citizens that are you know the mrs johnson in my ward that rents to a student that she doesn't end up having to pay if she's unaffiliated with the platform she got it then i have no further questions thank you thank you alderman riley thank you madam chairman and alderman harriston covered most of mine i do have um two questions and and obviously you've heard my feelings

RESPONSE:

The speaker is asking why residents who rent out units to short-term tenants should have to pay the same registration fee as companies that operate short-term rentals. They argue that this is unfair to residents who are not in the business of renting out units and are just renting to tenants for a short period of time.
