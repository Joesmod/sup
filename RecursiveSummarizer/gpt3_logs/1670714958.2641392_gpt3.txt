Write a concise summary of the following:


they were in meeting these goals and make the necessary adjustments to meet the goals.  So just to give you some perspective on the matter, in 2019, this is when we first made that change to give access to the tool.  We collected $128,000 in penalties or damages or assist damages.  And in 2021, we only collected 23,000 because the data is now at the forefront of the project when it comes to the prime and they have access to quickly adjust if they're not close to meeting the goals or be able to exceed the goal that they can.  Okay, so we track it pretty.  Does grievance have to be brought or is it one that automatically happens if their numbers don't line up? Grievance doesn't have to be brought up because we gave the tool to the vendors to track it themselves.  And so there is no this.  We didn't know, we were waiting for you to let us know where we were, that's no longer the case.  They have access to the data and they can track it.  We still make sure that we monitor it and ensure that these vendors are pursuing the goal.  And we ensure that they're looking at the data that's available to them.

All right.  Thank you, Chairman.  I just suggest that we could probably do the project area where the socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals are taken from first.  So we get to a couple of folks' concerns.  Thank you.  Thank you, thank you, Autumn-Keene.  As a follow up to the last question, what is the amount of the percentage of the penalty that is paid by a contractor if they do not meet the requirements? You're on mute, Commissioner.  So thank you.  Stressing the fact that the objective here
