the pulse of the community, getting to understand what the neighborhood needs, what the neighborhood wants and how they feel about it.  And I know that you did your due diligence on all sides of the issue from what you've been hearing from the outside.  And a lot of times people from the outside don't really understand what's going on on the inside.  Coincidentally, I have an issue coming up, a vote coming up for some TIF dollars and some other things to go toward some property in Cabrini-Green hosting development.  Hosting had a plan to build a certain amount of units for returning residents for Cabrini-Green to come back on that property and he had a certain amount of numbers to build.  Well, the economy changed, things changed.  Some of those things changed from townhomes to multi-family units.  He made his numbers.  Because he made his numbers, now he don't need to build on all the property anymore because he made his numbers.  So now we have two extra lots that he is not gonna build on and that CHA and the community, we're gonna do something different with it.  But the thing is, and what I'm trying to say is, with some of these developments for the returning residents and public housing, there was a commitment for a certain amount of numbers.  Initially, when they did these things, they had a plan to do a certain amount of square footage on all these properties.  But those things evolved and changed because of banking and economy and a whole bunch of other things that emerged and some of the buildings got a little larger, got bigger and now they have all this land now.  And at the same time, when you put a new school in the community, it brings up the value in the whole area, right? A new school is an economic development engine in a community.  That's why at one time I was trying to get the Obama High School open my area, not just to have the Obama High School, but I was trying to get the Obama High School to compliment the public housing and the redevelopment
