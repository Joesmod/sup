RESPONSE:

This section imposes a charge on methane emissions that exceed an applicable waste emissions threshold from an owner or operator of an applicable facility that reports more than 25,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent of greenhouse gases emitted per year. The charge amount for an applicable facility shall be equal to the product of the number of metric tons of methane emissions reported for the facility that exceed the applicable annual waste emissions threshold multiplied by $900 for emissions reported for calendar year 2024, $1,200 for emissions reported for calendar year 2025, or $1,500 for emissions reported for calendar year 2026 and thereafter.
