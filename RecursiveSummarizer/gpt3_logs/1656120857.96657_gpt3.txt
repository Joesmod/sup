Casey v. Planned Parenthood continues to be true: Within the constraints established by those decisions, a woman, not the government, should choose whether she will bear the burdens of pregnancy, childbirth, and parenting. The majority opinion invokes two watershed casesWest Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish and Brown v. Board of Educationin support of its holding, but those decisions are relevant only by contrast. West Coast Hotel overruled Adkins v. Children's Hospital of D. C., and a whole line of cases beginning with Lochner v. New York, while Brown overruled Plessy v. Ferguson. In both cases, the Court responded to changed law and to changed facts and attitudes that had taken hold throughout society. The experience of the Great Depression undermined the assumption that a wholly unregulated market could meet basic human needs, and the Court caught up with this new reality in West Coast Hotel. In Brown, the Court recognized that the "separate but equal" doctrine of Plessy v. Ferguson was untenable in light of the changed social and legal landscape. The majority opinion in this case, by contrast, fails to take account of either changed law or changed facts and attitudes. It is out of step with the rest of the world, and it fails to provide a compelling justification for overturning the right to choose.  In 1931, the Supreme Court ruled in Ins. Co. v. United States that the statements in previous decisions that were "impossible to reconcile" with Adkins v. Children's Hospital, 300 U. S. 398 (1931), were overruled. In 1954, the Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education that segregation was unconstitutional. Segregation was not, and could not ever be, consistent with the Reconstruction Amendments, ratified to give the former slaves full citizenship. The Brown Court explained that state-sanctioned segregation "affect[ed] [children's] hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone." Brown, 347 U. S., at 494. In a series of decisions, the Court had held unconstitutional public graduate schools exclusion of black students. The logic of those cases, Brown held, appl[ied] with added force to children in grade and high schools. 347 U. S., at 494. The majority says that in recognizing those changes, we are implicitly supporting the half-century interlude between Plessy and Brown. The Brown Court thought that whether the ratification-era history supported desegregation was [a]t best . . . inconclusive. 347 U. S., at 489. But even setting that aside, we are not saying that a decision can never be overruled just because it is terribly wrong. Take West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624, which the majority also relies on. Barnette and Brown, moreover, share another feature setting them apart from the Courts ruling today. They protected individual rights with a strong basis in the Constitutions most fundamental commitments; they did not, as the majority does here, take away a right that individuals have held, and relied on, for 50 years.

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court case of Casey v. Planned Parenthood continues to hold true that within the constraints established by the Court, a woman should be able to choose whether to bear the burdens of pregnancy, childbirth, and parenting. The majority opinion in the case invokes two previous Supreme Court cases, West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish and Brown v. Board of Education, in support of its holding. However, the relevance of these cases is only by contrast. West Coast Hotel overruled Adkins v. Children's Hospital of D. C., and a whole line of cases beginning with Lochner v. New York, while Brown overruled Plessy v. Ferguson. In both cases, the Court responded to changed law and to changed facts and attitudes that had taken hold throughout society. The experience of the Great Depression undermined the assumption that a wholly unregulated market could meet basic human needs, and the Court caught up with this new reality in West Coast Hotel. In Brown, the Court recognized that the "separate but equal" doctrine of Plessy v. Ferguson was untenable in light of the changed social and legal landscape. The majority opinion in Casey v. Planned Parenthood fails to take account of either changed law or changed facts and attitudes. It is out of step with the rest of the world, and it fails to provide a compelling justification for overturning the right to choose.
