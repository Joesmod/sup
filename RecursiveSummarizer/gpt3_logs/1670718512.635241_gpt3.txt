PROMPT:

Write an explanation of the following and how it is a waste of the City's money:


that system or that foundation, how can we leverage those economies? Because the price of construction is just going up, it hasn't been going down.  And so, when we also think about scale, scale is important to think about what are the policy things that we can do beyond just paying for every brick? And so, I think some of the stuff we heard today with the alderman suggestion was to get together and figure out how do we designate areas for a little community or not, the challenges that the private market has to pay for affordable is the fact that it costs more than that, you know, it doesn't generate enough for the operating cost.  And so, if we can bring together these different policy instruments that are just, aren't just capital sources, but also, you know, the operating sources, that's when you start having a larger scale and affordability.  So, ARO, when I started, was not a real generator of housing and not a generated units, but over time, the policy and support from this board has really helped move that needle to where 20% can be normalized, which is a fantastic way to get additional scale.  Yeah.  I think, and absolutely, I think in terms of the ARO, I think that there's, like I said, doomsday never happened.  The 20% was feasible, right? So, I think that we got to be cautioned in kind of how the market is pushing, right? Because we know that these issues will not be addressed by the market.  So, investment in public works is critical.  So, I look forward to, again, identifying opportunities locally on how we can scale up at the year-to-year point, worldwide reward is going to be critical and using effective ways of repurposing, you know, facilities that right now sit empty, right? So, and I think the needle housing is dire.  So, I appreciate and look forward to working together.  Thank you.  Any other questions, members of the committee? Going back on the agenda to item number four, at the request of Alderman Dahl, development in her community, there's
