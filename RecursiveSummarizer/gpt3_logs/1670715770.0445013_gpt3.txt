Write a concise summary of the following:


you could put together one page or on where your funding comes from, from the various funding streams and get it to Michael, and then Michael if you can get it to the committee will make sure we get it to the members.

Since you've been there I would appreciate that before I go to all the men Lopez I want to recognize that we're joined by all the men Mitchell, capital men and Maldonado all the men Lopez.
