CONCISE SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

The City is selling a portion of city-owned property to the applicant for $264.15. The sale is based on the market value of the property, minus the portion of the city parcel that the applicant is proposing to use for their own purposes. Alderman Roberto Meldinado supports the sale.
