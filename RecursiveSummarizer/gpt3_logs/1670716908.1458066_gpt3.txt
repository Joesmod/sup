PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


other black and brown on minority contractors, I hate using the word minority but you know what I mean, bringing others to give them some sort of incentive as being a prime contractor bidding on larger projects.  Well, some of our recommendations, did touch on on that.  One of course is is paying promptly because it's a disincentive to become a prime contractor if you're the last one holding you know the contracting bag so to speak.  The meant the bonding and financing support program to help people be able to take on bigger more complex jobs as as as primes on bundling the contracts into smaller chunks so that they can continue to to do them as they grow.  And the city does have both the small business initiative and the mid size business initiative.  They're in that that list of bid incentives that DPS has.  And that's a place that that we suggested some attention might be paid to try to make sure that the minority women owned firms when they are no longer eligible in the program, still have opportunities, at least to compete against like size firms, you know, it's not a shot.  It's not a like a set aside where we're going to say only minority firms can bid that work, but it would be a way to level the playing field a bit between them and the really big boys so I think there are lots of things that could be done to to assist and WBS as they exit the program to be successful as prime contractors.
