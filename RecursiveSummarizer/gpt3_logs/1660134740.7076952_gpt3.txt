RESPONSE:

This section establishes a formula for determining the rebate amount and inflation-adjusted payment amount for certain drugs. The formula is applied as if the CPIU were defined as if the reference to January 2021 were a reference to January of the first year after the date on which the drug was first marketed. For drugs that are line extensions of other drugs, the formula is applied consistent with the formula used for determining rebate obligations under section 1927. For selected drugs that are no longer considered selected drugs, the payment amount benchmark period is the last year during the price applicability period.
