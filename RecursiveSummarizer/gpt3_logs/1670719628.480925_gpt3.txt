PROMPT:

Write a summary of the following conversation:


lot of the description that we heard today would be powerful arguments that they may not be a public  accommodation in what they do. But we simply  don't have those facts here. But, certainly, the level of selectivity, the -- the way in which the -- the potential customer engages with the -- the client -- I'm sorry, with the service provider, and how the service provider makes their product available or -- or known to the public all factor in in that analysis. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Yeah, and I'd like to ask you a question about one other case. It's the one you rely on most heavily in your brief, Rumsfeld against FAIR. And it seems to me that a distinction you have to deal with in that case is that the speech there was not compelled, or what was compelled was not considered speech.

First is, in FAIR, it recognized that  there was some speech by the schools. There were e-mails, posters on bulletin boards, et cetera. So there was some speech, but it said it was incidental, like in O'Brien, to the purpose of the regulation, which was ensuring equal access, similar to Colorado's law here. And -- and the second point I would make, and it comes from the example of the identical website being turned away for the same-sex couple but provided to the opposite-sex couple, here, sometimes the speech itself does not change. And what this company seeks, if you look at the -- the specific prayer for relief in the complaint, is a total permission to turn away every
