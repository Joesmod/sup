S. 1 (1967); and Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U. S. 644 (2015). I emphasize what the Court today states: Overruling Roe does not mean the overruling of those precedents, and does not threaten or cast doubt on those precedents. Second, as I see it, some of the other abortion-related legal questions raised by todays decision are not especially difficult as a constitutional matter. For example, may a State bar a resident of that State from traveling to another State to obtain an abortion? In my view, the answer is no based on the constitutional right to interstate travel. May a State retroactively impose liability or punishment for an abortion that occurred before todays decision takes effect? In my view, the answer is no based on the Due Process Clause or the Ex Post Facto Clause. Cf. Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U. S. 347 (1964). Other abortion-related legal questions may emerge in the  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 11 KAVANAUGH, J., concurring future. But this Court will no longer decide the fundamental question of whether abortion must be allowed throughout the United States through 6 weeks, or 12 weeks, or 15 weeks, or 24 weeks, or some other line. The Court will no longer decide how to evaluate the interests of the pregnant woman and the interests in protecting fetal life throughout pregnancy. Instead, those difficult moral and policy questions will be decided, as the Constitution dictates, by the people and their elected representatives through the constitutional processes of democratic self-government. * * * The Roe Court took sides on a consequential moral and policy issue that this Court had no constitutional authority to decide. By taking sides, the Roe Court distorted the Nations understanding of this Courts proper role in the American constitutional system and thereby damaged the Court as an institution. As Justice Scalia explained, Roe destroyed the compromises of the past, rendered compromise impossible for the future, and required the entire issue to be resolved uniformly, at the national level. Casey, 505 U. S., at 995 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). The Courts decision today properly returns the Court to a position of judicial neutrality on the issue of abortion, and properly restores the peoples authority to resolve the issue of abortion through the processes of democratic selfgovernment established by the Constitution. To be sure, many Americans will disagree with the Courts decision today. That would be true no matter how the Court decided this case. Both sides on the abortion issue believe sincerely and passionately in the rightness of their cause. Especially in those difficult and fraught circumstances, the Court must scrupulously adhere to the Constitutions neutral position on the issue of abortion. Since 1973,

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court has ruled on several key cases regarding contraception and marriage, including Griswold v. Connecticut, Eisenstadt v. Baird, Loving v. Virginia, and Obergefell v. Hodges. Today's decision does not overturn any of these previous rulings, but simply states that the fundamental question of whether or not abortion must be allowed throughout the United States is no longer something that the Court will decide. This issue will now be decided by the people and their elected representatives through the constitutional processes of democratic self-government.
