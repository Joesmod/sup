RESPONSE:

In Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the Supreme Court must decide what standard of review will apply to future challenges to state abortion regulations, and whether the law before the Court satisfies that standard. The Court has previously held that rational-basis review is the appropriate standard, but the plaintiffs in this case argue that strict scrutiny should apply. The Court finds that the plaintiffs have not met their burden of showing that strict scrutiny is the appropriate standard, and therefore affirms the lower court's decision that the law in question is constitutional. The majority opinion, written by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, finds that Roe was wrongly decided and should be overturned. The concurrence, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, agrees that Roe was wrongly decided but would not overturn it outright. Instead, the concurrence would hold that the right to abortion ends once women have had "a reasonable opportunity" to obtain one. The majority opinion criticizes the concurrence for its failure to offer any principled basis for its approach. The concurrence concedes that its approach would "not be available" if the rationale of Roe and Casey were inextricably linked to the viability standard.
