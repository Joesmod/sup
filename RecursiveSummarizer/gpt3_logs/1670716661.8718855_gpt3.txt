Write a concise summary of the following:


that you calculated and then what did you kind of re wait for, what was the change I guess.  Well, I need to go back to the report I don't ever want to try to do numbers from memory especially when they're several months away but we took the actual headcount.  Let me just make up a number that is wrong but for ease of exposition.  If you don't know the number I was.  I don't want you to guess right yeah concepts.  Right it's in the report and if, and if there's a difference that before Council on next week if you can provide that number to me.  Yeah, that would be great I don't I thought you could say, you know, went from 3% and up 2% or something I don't know.  But yeah, if you can provide that information through the chair that would be great.  Another question I had, and you mentioned and, you know, some of the things that you're recommending to change is a restriction on the certified firms.  Can you speak to what that is specifically and why you're recommending the change.  Well, there were two really.  The first was the limit on the gross first annual gross I get that one.  That one I get.  Okay.  Okay.  The location.  The workforce, it to me I think that means that the company, the majority of the company has to be domiciled in the six county region but that's why I'm asking for an explanation.  Sure.  My understanding of the way that the city's always applied this and this is really from the very first ordinance that I worked on back in 1990 under album in Austin's to the original Austin was this restriction that the majority of an applicant's full of an independent firms, full time workforce must be located in the six county region.  Right.  Yeah, after 31 years I don't actually remember anymore why we thought that but, but it certainly was was nothing that ever was continued in any other ordinance or anyplace else across the country.  It seemed to us that this was a burden that we placed on minority owned firms that non minority firms just didn't have to


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The workforce restriction on certified firms requires that the majority of an applicant's full-time workforce must be located in the six county region. This is a burden that is placed on minority owned firms that non minority firms do not have to worry about.
