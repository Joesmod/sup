This section of the bill deals with the treatment of foreign corporations for the purposes of the repurchase of stock by a covered corporation.

A specified affiliate of a foreign corporation is also treated as a covered corporation for the purposes of this section. The adjustment under subsection (c)(3) shall be determined only with respect to stock issued or provided by such specified affiliate to employees of the specified affiliate.
