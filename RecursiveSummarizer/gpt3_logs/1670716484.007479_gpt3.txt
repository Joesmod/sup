PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


can we as Audubon help you all overcome those challenges? Yeah, I think it is a challenge, but we're up for the challenge and we are always looking for a new challenge.  We are always looking for new ways to improve on that.  However, with that recent procurement, our procurement program is set up for lowest bidder, lowest responsive bidder.  And we looked over our bid tabulations.  Every contractor that was awarded was the lowest most responsive bidder.  And we did only have two firms during that time that were minority certified.  So if it's a matter of getting the companies to participate in the solicitation, we can always improve on that.  But we worked with what we had to evaluate at the time.  And at that time, more than half of those responsive bidders were not certified.  So we had to choose based on the lowest dollar value.  Okay, I know you're gonna be providing through the chairs we requested before, how they satisfy their MBE, WBE goals for these projects.  I would also like to know if you can provide this in the mix, what percentage of the projects goes to each of those subcontractors? Because what I've been hearing is frequently and almost to make your bid look better, they spread that requirement that go all out so far that each sub is getting maybe one, 2% of the project, which really makes it hard for them to throw their capacities.  So in your response, if you could help us understand not the broad percentage of what goes towards minority or rim-owned businesses, but how they break down that percentage would be really helpful.  Certainly, we'll do that Alderman Lascada, thank you.  Thank you Chair.  Thank you.  Mr.  Chairman.  He may be muted.  I'm sorry, I'm muted.  Okay, thank you.  Alderman King, go ahead and follow up on me down.  Yeah, thank you Chairman.  I kind of had a point of clarification.  You said lowest responsible bidder.  What do you mean when you say responsible? Hi, Alderman King.  Yeah, I thought I said responsive and responsive

RESPONSE:

The city of Chicago is looking to improve its minority business participation, and has asked the Audubon Society for help. The Society says it is up for the challenge, and that it is always looking for new ways to improve. However, the city's procurement program is set up for the lowest bidder, and this can sometimes mean that minority-owned businesses are not given a fair chance to compete. The city is hoping to change this, and is asking the Audubon Society for help in increasing minority participation.
