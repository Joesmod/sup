PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:

lawmakers whose votes were needed to enact these laws were motivated by hostility to Catholics and women? There is ample evidence that the passage of these laws was instead spurred by a sincere belief that abortion kills a human being. Many judicial decisions from the late 19th and early 20th centuries made that point. See, e.g., Nash v. Meyer, 54 Idaho 283, 301, 31 P. 2d 273, 280 (1934); State v. Ausplund, 86 Ore. 121, 131132, 167 P. 1019, 10221023 (1917); Trent v. State, 15 Ala. App. 485, 488, 73 S. 834, 836 (1916); State v. Miller, 90 Kan. 230, 233, 133 P. 878, 879 (1913); State v. Tippie, 89 Ohio St. 35, 3940, 105 N. E. 75, 77 (1913); State v. Gedicke, 43 N. J. L. 86, 90 (1881); Dougherty v. People, 1 Colo. 514, 522523 (1873); State v. Moore, 25 Iowa 128, 131132 (1868); Smith, 33 Me., at 57; see also Memphis Center for Reproductive Health v. Slatery, 14 F. 4th 409, 446, and n. 11 (CA6 2021) (Thapar, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (citing cases). One may disagree with this belief (and our decision is not based on any view about when a State should regard prenatal life as having rights or legally cognizable interests),  30 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court but even Roe and Casey did not question the good faith of abortion opponents. See, e.g., Casey, 505 U. S., at 850 (Men and women of good conscience can disagree . . . about the profound moral and spiritual implications of terminating a pregnancy even in its earliest stage). And we see no reason to discount the significance of the state laws in question based on these amicis suggestions about legislative motive.41 C 1 Instead of seriously pressing the argument that the abortion right itself has deep roots, supporters of Roe and Casey contend that the abortion right is an integral part of a broader entrenched right. Roe termed this a right to privacy, 410 U. S., at 154, and Casey described it as the freedom to make intimate and personal choices that are central to personal dignity and autonomy, 505 U. S., at 851. Casey elaborated: At the heart of liberty is the right to define ones own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Ibid. The Court did not claim that this broadly framed right is absolute, and no such claim would be plausible. While individuals are certainly free to think and to say what they  41Other amicus briefs present arguments about the motives of proponents of liberal access to abortion. They note that some such supporters have been motivated by a desire to suppress the size of the AfricanAmerican population. See Brief for African-American Organization et al. as Amici Curiae 1421; see also Box v. Planned Parenthood of Ind. and Ky., Inc., 587 U. S. ___, ______ (2019) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (slip op., at 14). And it is beyond dispute that Roe has had that demographic effect. A highly disproportionate percentage of aborted fetuses are Black. See, e.g.,

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The passage of laws restricting abortion was motivated not by hostility to Catholics and women, but by a sincere belief that abortion kills a human being. This belief is based on judicial decisions from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood did not question the good faith of abortion opponents.
