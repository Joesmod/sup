Write a concise summary of the following:

the possibility of doing so in the future.  The Court has overruled precedents before, and it is within the Court's discretion to do so again. In this case, the Court has overruled Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood, concluding that a state ban on abortion after fifteen weeks is constitutional. The majority opinion argues that this ban provides sufficient time for a woman to make an informed decision about whether to terminate her pregnancy.  The Court overrules Roe and Casey, which established the viability rule that a woman has a right to an abortion up to the point of viability. The Court does so despite the fact that doing so will create upheaval and that a narrower decision would have sufficed. The Court cites three previous cases in which it overruled precedent, but none of them are directly analogous to the present case.  The Supreme Court has ruled that a woman's right to choose whether or not to have an abortion is protected by the Constitution, and that any restrictions on abortion must be based on the woman's health and not on the government's interest in protecting the fetus.  The Court has struck a balance in the past between the State's interest in protecting fetal life and a woman's right to choose abortion, but today's ruling discards that balance. The Court says that from the moment of fertilization, a woman has no rights to speak of and a State can force her to carry a pregnancy to term. This will allow States to enact all sorts of restrictions on abortion, including bans on the procedure without any exceptions for rape or incest.  The Supreme Court has ruled that states can criminalize abortion, which will disproportionately impact poor women who cannot afford to travel to another state for the procedure. This decision will also make it more difficult for women to access abortion medication from out of state.  The majority in this case holds that the Constitution will provide no shield against today's majority, despite its guarantees of liberty and equality for all. This means that the right to an abortion is not deeply rooted in history and is therefore not protected by the Constitution. The dissenting opinion argues that this is hypocritical and that the majority is simply overturning precedent without a good reason.  The Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that legalized abortion in the United States. In a close 5-4 decision, the Court ruled that states may now ban abortion outright or place severe restrictions on the procedure. The decision is a major victory for anti-abortion activists and a devastating blow to women's reproductive rights.  The Court held that in the earlier stages of pregnancy, the choice of whether or not to have an abortion must belong to the woman, in consultation with her family and doctor. The Court explained that a long line of precedents, founded in the Fourteenth Amendments concept of personal liberty, protected individual decisionmaking related to marriage,
