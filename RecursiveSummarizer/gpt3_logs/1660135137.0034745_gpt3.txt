CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

This section amends section 179D of the tax code to allow a deduction for energy efficient commercial buildings. The deduction is available to licensed architects or engineers who meet other requirements as provided by the Secretary. The deduction is not available for energy efficient building retrofit property if a deduction is already allowed for that property under this section. The inflation adjustment for the deduction is increased for 2020 and 2021.
