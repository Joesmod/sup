Write a concise summary of the following:


included under this ordinance as it's currently drafted, but would have had an opportunity on that construction project if it was moved to a social economic disadvantaged area.  So with that, we turn it over to Mike Massalayo.  Good afternoon, everyone.  Thank you, Mr.  Chairman and committee members.  We appreciate you inviting us to participate in this call.  And I think Jay pretty much hit it on the head.  As everyone knows the billing trade, the Chicago Federation of Labor and a few others were the founding groups of Hire360.  We're very proud of the work that's being done there.  I can't say enough about Jay and the team at 360 and what they've done, especially with the pandemic.  And now that we're coming out of it, we're just seeing some of the results of the labor that's been put into this.  So, I can tell you Chairman, I circulated the ordinance that you gave to us last Thursday.  I didn't receive any negative feedback.  I received positive.  The feedback I received was positive about that.  Obviously, if there's a new document that needs to be circulated, I will do that as soon as we receive it.  And I'll ask for input at that time.  But in its current form, everybody seemed very positive that they think it's a good thing and it'll create more opportunity.  So, thank you very much.  Thank you, Jay and Mike.  And we will go back to questions with Alderman, Alderman of Sophia King, but I do want to add Alderman Cichol Lopez to the role for the meeting.  Go ahead, Alderman King.  Thank you.  Thank you, Chairman.  I got a little more clarity on what you're trying to do here.  So, I appreciate that.  I will maybe suggest that we change it to socioeconomic individuals in the project area, receive preference first.  So, maybe that will get to Alderman Dowell's point.  And then, but I guess, how is project area defined? Because that's really what you're changing.  You're changing it from the project area to include individuals with socio, from socioeconomically


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The ordinance being discussed would give preference to socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals when awarding construction contracts. The project area would be defined as the area where the construction project is taking place.
