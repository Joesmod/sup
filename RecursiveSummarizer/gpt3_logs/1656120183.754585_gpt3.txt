accordingly. Some states have recently enacted laws allowing abortion with few restrictions at all stages of pregnancy, while other states have tightly restricted abortion beginning well before viability. In this case, the state of Mississippi is asking the Supreme Court to uphold a law that generally prohibits abortion after the 15th week of pregnancy. In defending this law, the states primary argument is that the Court should reconsider and overturn Roe and Casey, and allow each state to regulate abortion as its citizens wish. Respondents and the Solicitor General, on the other hand, argue that the Court should reaffirm Roe and Casey and strike down the Mississippi law. They contend that allowing Mississippi to prohibit abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy would be the same as overruling Roe and Casey entirely.  The Supreme Court case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization is summarized. The case is about Mississippi's Gestational Age Act, which outlaws abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The respondents in the case argued that the law violates the right to abortion established in Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood. The Supreme Court ruled that Roe and Casey must be overruled, and that the right to abortion is not protected by the Constitution.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that the Act was constitutional. The Court of Appeals reasoned that this Courts decisions establishing a right to abortion were based on the premise that the fetus is not a person within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. See, e.g., Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, 153 (1973). But, the Court of Appeals continued, if the fetus is a person, as the legislature had found, then the State has a compelling interest in forbidding elective abortions after the point at which the unborn child is capable of feeling pain. 791 F. 3d, at 540. The Court of Appeals therefore upheld the Acts ban on abortions after 15 weeks gestation, as well as its requirement that, after that point, abortions be performed in a manner that gives the unborn child the best chance of being born alive. In this case, the Supreme Court of the United States is being asked to decide whether the Mississippi Gestational Age Act violates the Constitution. The Act bans abortions after 15 weeks of gestation, with the exception of cases of medical emergency or severe fetal abnormality. It also requires that, after that point, abortions be performed in a manner that gives the unborn child the best chance of being born alive. The Supreme Court has previously recognized a constitutional right to abortion, but that right has been based on the premise that the fetus is not a "person" within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. If the fetus is a person, as the Mississippi legislature has found, then the State has a compelling interest in forbidding elective abortions after the point at which the unborn child is capable of feeling pain.

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court is being asked to decide whether the Mississippi Gestational Age Act violates the Constitution. The Act bans abortions after 15 weeks of gestation, with the exception of cases of medical emergency or severe fetal abnormality. It also requires that, after that point, abortions be performed in a manner that gives the unborn child the best chance of being born alive. The Supreme Court has previously recognized a constitutional right to abortion, but that right has been based on the premise that the fetus is not a "person" within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. If the fetus is a person, as the Mississippi legislature has found, then the State has a compelling interest in forbidding elective abortions after the point at which the unborn child is capable of feeling pain. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the Act, reasoning that if the fetus is a person, then the state has a compelling interest in protecting its life. The Supreme Court is now being asked to determine whether the Act violates the Constitution.
