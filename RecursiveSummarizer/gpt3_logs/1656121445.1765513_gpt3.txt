contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process. Ibid. And it restrains judicial hubris and reminds us to respect the judgment of those who have grappled with important questions in the past. Precedent is a way of accumulating and passing down the learning of past generations, a font of established wisdom richer than what can be found in any single judge or panel of judges. N. Gorsuch, A Republic, If You Can Keep It 217 (2019). We have long recognized, however, that stare decisis is not an inexorable command, Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U. S. 223, 233 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted), and it is at its weakest when we interpret the Constitution, Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 235 (1997). It has been said that it is sometimes more important that an issue be settled than that it be settled right. Kimble, 576 U. S., at 455 (quoting Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U.

JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court dure through a long lapse of ages, Martin v. Hunters Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 326 (1816) (opinion for the Court by Story, J.)we place a high value on having the matter settled right. In addition, when one of our constitutional decisions goes astray, the country is usually stuck with the bad decision unless we correct our own mistake. An erroneous constitutional decision can be fixed by amending the Constitution, but our Constitution is notoriously hard to amend. See Art. V; Kimble, 576 U. S., at 456. Therefore, in appropriate circumstances we must be willing to reconsider and, if necessary, overrule constitutional decisions. Some of our most important constitutional decisions have overruled prior precedents. We mention three. In Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954), the Court repudiated the separate but equal doctrine, which had allowed States to maintain racially segregated schools and other facilities. Id., at 488 (internal quotation marks omitted). In so doing, the Court overruled the infamous decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537 (1896), along with six other Supreme Court precedents that had applied the separate-but-equal rule. See Brown, 347 U. S., at 491. In West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 (1937), the Court overruled Adkins v. Childrens Hospital of D. C., 261 U. S. 525 (1923), which had held that a law setting minimum wages for women violated the liberty protected by the Fifth Amendments Due Process Clause. Id., at 545. West Coast Hotel signaled the demise of an entire line of important precedents that had protected an individual liberty right against state and federal health and welfare legislation. See Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905) (holding invalid a law setting maximum working hours); Coppage v. Kansas, 236 U. S. 1 (1915) (holding

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The U.S. Supreme Court has long recognized that the doctrine of stare decisis is not an inexorable command, and that it is at its weakest when interpreting the Constitution. The Court has also acknowledged that an erroneous constitutional decision can be corrected by amending the Constitution, but that this is notoriously difficult to do. Therefore, in appropriate circumstances, the Court must be willing to reconsider and, if necessary, overrule constitutional decisions.
