Write a concise summary of the following:

that legalized abortion, in a 5-4 decision. The Court's conservative majority ruled that states can ban abortion from the time of conception. This ruling will have a major impact on women's reproductive rights and could lead to more states banning abortion altogether.  The Supreme Court has overruled prior precedent in 28 cases, finding that the rule of law has been betrayed by the Court in each instance. In each of these cases, the Court relied on traditional stare decisis factors in overruling.  The Court overruled a prior precedent, Walton v. Arizona, 497 U. S. 639 (1990), which held that a defendant may make a prima facie showing of purposeful racial discrimination in selection of a jury venire by relying solely on the facts in his case. The Court held that the rule in Swain v. Alabama, 380 U. S. 202 (1965), which imposed a more demanding evidentiary burden, was no longer good law.  The majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization cites several cases where the Supreme Court has overruled prior precedent. In each of these cases, the Court found that either the doctrinal foundations of the prior decision had been undermined, or that changed facts or understandings had made the prior decision no longer viable.  The Supreme Court has overruled several of its own decisions in the past, based on changed social understandings or developments in the law. In doing so, the Court has recognized that its prior decisions may no longer be consistent with the Constitution.  The majority opinion in the present case cites several prior cases which it claims are analogous to the present case, where the court is overruling two longstanding constitutional precedents. However, none of the cases cited by the majority are actually analogous, as they all involve relatively minor modifications to existing precedent, rather than the wholesale overturning of two major constitutional principles.
