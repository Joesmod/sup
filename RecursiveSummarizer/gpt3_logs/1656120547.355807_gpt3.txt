act that terminates life or potential life. This decision was made in response to the Roe v. Wade case, which established a woman's constitutional right to abortion. The Court emphasized that their decision only concerns the right to abortion, and should not be interpreted to cast doubt on other precedent-setting cases. The Court also addressed the argument that overturning Roe v. Wade would be seen as a surrender to political pressure, and explained that the Judicial Branch's legitimacy comes from interpreting the Constitution, not from following public opinion.  The United States Supreme Court has overruled the landmark case of Roe v. Wade, which had established a constitutional right to abortion. The Court has also overruled the more recent case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which had reaffirmed Roe. In doing so, the Court has held that the Constitution does not protect a right to abortion. The Court's decision was based on the principle of stare decisis, which holds that precedent should generally be followed. However, the Court noted that precedent is not binding if it is clearly erroneous. The Court found that both Roe and Casey were clearly erroneous and should be overruled. The Court's decision will likely have far-reaching implications for abortion law in the United States. It is unclear how exactly the decision will play out, but it is likely that many States will now ban abortion entirely or severely restrict it.  The Court ruled that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion, overruling Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey. The dissent argued that the Court had abandoned stare decisis, but the Court explained that it had not done so and that the dissent's understanding of stare decisis was the one that broke with tradition. The dissent's argument was that the Court should never (or almost never) overrule an egregiously wrong constitutional precedent unless the Court could "point to major legal or factual changes undermining [the] decision's original basis." The Court explained that this was not the correct view of stare decisis and that overruling an egregiously wrong decision is sometimes justified.  The Supreme Court has revisited the question of whether Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood should be overturned, and has decided that they should be. The Court's decision is based on a number of factors, including the failure of the Casey plurality's call for "the contending sides" in the abortion debate to "end their national division," the post-Casey developments that have made the issue more contentious, and the fact that the Casey precedent is not shielded from reconsideration by traditional stare decisis principles.

The United States Supreme Court has overruled the landmark case of Roe v. Wade, which had established a constitutional right to abortion. In doing so, the Court has held that the Constitution does not protect a right to abortion.

The Court explained that this was not the correct view of stare decisis and that overruling an egregiously wrong decision is sometimes justified. The Court is considering whether to overturn or reaffirm Roe v. Wade, the case that established a woman's right to abortion. The Court is taking into account a number of factors, including the failure of the Casey plurality's call for "the contending sides" in the abortion debate to "end their national division," the post-Casey developments that have made the issue more contentious, and the fact that the Casey precedent is not shielded from reconsideration by traditional stare decisis principles.
