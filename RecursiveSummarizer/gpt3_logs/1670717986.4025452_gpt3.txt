RESPONSE:

The state law setting up this program does not have criteria for what can be designated as a low affordability community. However, in other jurisdictions outside of Chicago, the criteria is that municipalities have less than forty percent of affordable rental housing. This is a good metric for determining what could be a low affordability community. The project is located in the near west side community area, which has only seventeen percent of its total units of housing that are legally restricted affordable housing. In addition, this is a higher opportunity neighborhood with low unemployment and high access to jobs and transit.
