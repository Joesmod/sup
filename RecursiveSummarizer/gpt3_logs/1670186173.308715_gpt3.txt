Write a concise summary of the following:


management ordinance, is that we are looking at the whole realm of kind of feasibility, what best practices are you know what the best Department of Environment around the country look like looking within about who has what responsibilities right now within city government within the department so that you know we are thoughtfully pulling that apart if that's kind of you know where we end up at as you know the question around enforcement the question around, you know, different pieces.  You know between a is, you know, CDP H seed out every, there's a lot of pieces and we want to also thoughtfully look at all the roles and responsibilities, and then get to the right ordinance at the end of the day, you know, looking at who has to do what so I think it's all important to start and I'm sure you know as that rolls forward on that there may be other things that we will look at, and I'm, I'm, I'm assuming, let me, let me.  I'm just going to talk about you know, with all the respect, Madam Chair, one to 100 I think you know we need to get that we need to get there quicker.

Well, I heard about that promise four years ago so we could have done that so at any rate, who will be conducting a study, how will it be funded.  On the study.  We are in the process of designing the scope and talking to CCA about pro bono consulting to help support the study, and I will also add that the study will be done with a robust stakeholder process, both to engage people that serve within the city now to think about their existing roles, and where those roles might be combined, working with stakeholders across the city and of course with leadership, like folks in this room to identify the best governance structure possible.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The city is looking to study how best to reorganize its departments to better protect the environment. This will include looking at how other similar departments are structured and run in other cities, as well as engaging stakeholders in the process. The goal is to come up with a plan for the best possible governance structure for the city. The study will be conducted by CCA (pro bono) and should take about six months.
