Write a concise summary of the following:

allow states to ban abortion destroys the individual plans and expectations of women and diminishes their opportunities to participate fully and equally in the nation's political, social, and economic life.  The Supreme Court's ruling in Roe v. Wade has been overturned, and states are now able to ban abortion. This will have a particularly hard impact on low-income women, who will not be able to afford to travel to states where abortion is still legal. Many will be forced to turn to illegal and unsafe abortions, which could lead to their death.  The Supreme Court has ruled that Mississippi can restrict abortion care without addressing any of the financial, health, and family needs that motivate many women to seek it. This will have a disproportionately negative effect on poor women, who will be forced to seek illegal abortions in dangerous conditions.  The Court's decision today is a radical claim to power, disregarding the interests of women who have relied on Roe and Casey to make decisions about their lives. The majority cannot escape its obligation to consider the costs of its decision on those who have relied on it, and its insistence on a concrete, economic showing would preclude a finding of reliance on a wide variety of decisions recognizing constitutional rights.  The Supreme Court has ruled that the right to an abortion is not absolute, and that states can place restrictions on the procedure. This decision overturns the Court's previous rulings in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which had established a woman's right to choose an abortion. The majority opinion argues that these previous decisions were wrongly decided and that they have caused division in the country. The dissent argues that the Court should not be overturning settled law without considering the consequences for women who have relied on the right to choose an abortion.  The three dissenting justices in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization case argue that the majority's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade is a breach of faith that will damage the Court's legitimacy. They argue that the Court should have adhered to stare decisis, or the principle of precedent, in this case, as it is a highly charged and controversial issue. Justice Jackson once called a decision he dissented from a loaded weapon, ready to hand for improper uses. Korematsu v. United States, 323 U. S. 214, 246 (1944). The dissenters argue that the majority's decision today is its own loaded weapon.  The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the right to abortion for 50 years, and this right is embedded in our constitutional law. However, states have been passing laws to restrict abortion, and this trend has accelerated in recent years. The Court signaled this year that it is likely to roll back Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that established the right to abortion. This would be a devastating blow to women's reproductive rights.  The Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark case
