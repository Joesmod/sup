Write a concise summary of the following:

reexamination of Roe and Casey would be amply justified. We have already mentioned a number of post-Casey developments, see supra, at 3334, 5963, but the most profound change may be the failure of the Casey pluralitys call for the contending sides in the controversy about abortion to end their national division, 505 U. S., at Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 71 Opinion of the Court 867. That has not happened, and there is no reason to think that another decision sticking with Roe would achieve what Casey could not. The dissent, however, is undeterred. It contends that the very controversy surrounding Roe and Casey is an important stare decisis consideration that requires upholding those precedents. See post, at 5557. The dissent characterizes Casey as a precedent about precedent that is permanently shielded from further evaluation under traditional stare decisis principles. See post, at 57. But as we have explained, Casey broke new ground when it treated the national controversy provoked by Roe as a ground for refusing to reconsider that decision, and no subsequent case has relied on that factor. Our decision today simply applies longstanding stare decisis factors instead of applying a version of the doctrine that seems to apply only in abortion cases. 3 Finally, the dissent suggests that our decision calls into question Griswold, Eisenstadt, Lawrence, and Obergefell. Post, at 45, 2627, n. 8. But we have stated unequivocally that [n]othing in this opinion should be understood to cast doubt on precedents that do not concern abortion. Supra, at 66. We have also explained why that is so: rights regarding contraception and same-sex relationships are inherently different from the right to abortion because the latter (as we have stressed) uniquely involves what Roe and Casey termed potential life. Roe, 410 U. S., at 150 (emphasis deleted); Casey, 505 U. S., at 852. Therefore, a right to abortion cannot be justified by a purported analogy to the rights recognized in those other cases or by appeals to a broader right to autonomy. Supra, at 32. It is hard to see how we could be clearer. Moreover, even putting aside that these cases are distinguishable, there is a further point that the dissent ignores: Each precedent is subject to its own stare   72 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court decisis analysis, and the factors that our doctrine instructs us to consider like reliance and workability are different for these cases than for our abortion jurisprudence. B 1 We now turn to the concurrence in the judgment, which reproves us for deciding whether Roe and Casey should be retained or overruled. That opinion (which for convenience we will call simply the concurrence) recommends a more measured course, which it defends based on what it claims is a straightforward stare decisis analysis.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Court reconsidered the Roe and Casey decisions, which established a woman's right to an abortion. The Court found that the national controversy surrounding abortion has not ended, and that another decision upholding Roe would not achieve what Casey could not. The concurrence would leave for another day whether to reject any right to an abortion, but would instead focus on whether to uphold specific abortion regulations.
