org chart.  Sure, sure.  I appreciate that.  And the last question just following up to the NASIX code.  Do you think we need to have another category besides so we've got construction and non-construction.  Should professional services or goods and services be separated from that? Well, no, I think your structure is fine.  And of course, it's the result of the lawsuit.  So that's how we got to this point was meeting the federal judges requirements about what the construction program needs to be.  My understanding and, you know, again, Monica, correct me if I'm wrong here, but that all other types of goods and services are in the non-construction.  So we have two basic buckets here.  And I certainly not recommending messing with that and coming up with yet a third or fourth or fifth ordinance that, you know, would govern that.  I just don't know that there's much utility from that from a bureaucratic standpoint and it will add complexity with I'm not, I doubt, frankly, adding much clarity.  Okay.  All right.  Thank you for that.  Thank you, Chairman.  Thank you so much, Alderman Sophie-Akeem.  I'll go back one last time to Alderman Jeanette Taylor.  I see your hand is still up.  I don't know if you're still there.  Are you ready to ask your question? Okay.  I'm going to conclude that Alderman Jeanette Taylor doesn't have a question.  First of all, I want to thank the entire staff and procurement, Monica and Shauna, for always being accessible when I reached out to ask any questions and to especially to Collette Ho.  She's been in depth in terms of, you know, any questions I needed to get to try to make sure that we get information for this committee, including the 200 page document.  And just, you know, making sure that you are accessible, but all the work that you put into this and you made it a real understanding in terms of what we have to do.  And I think it's incumbent upon us as we look at this, because like you said, we always talk about numbers and numbers

RESPONSE:

The city is discussing its org chart and whether or not to add another category for construction and non-construction. It is decided that there is no need for another category, as it would add bureaucratic complexity without much clarity.
