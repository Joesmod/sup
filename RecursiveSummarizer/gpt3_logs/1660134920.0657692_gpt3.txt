RESPONSE:

The 15 qualified facility tax credit is available to taxpayers who have requested qualified apprentices from a registered apprenticeship program, and have been denied, provided that such denial is not the result of a refusal by the taxpayer or any contractors or subcontractors engaged in the performance of construction, alteration, or repair work with respect to such qualified facility to comply with the established standards and requirements of the registered apprenticeship program. If the Secretary determines that any failure is due to intentional disregard of the requirements, the credit shall be applied by substituting $500 for $50.
