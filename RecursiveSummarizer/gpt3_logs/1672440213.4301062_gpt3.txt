them when we started to plan for transformation.  And that's my commitment today.  Although I believe that CHA has a responsibility to rethink the plan for transformation and do even more units, the LAC and the CAC are in support of this.  They've provided both letters from both the Central Advisory Council and from the LAC representative at IKEs home.  As a matter of fact, the LAC president I worked with from 99 to 2008 passed on, but her daughter is that LAC president now or representative and she provided a letter and from the Central Advisory Council, they support the new school coming to 24th and State Street, Hale, IKE South, the bridge land.  So long as the remaining CHA public housing units are being built on the footprints of Hale, IKE South bridge on site, not up the street, down the street or around the corner.  That's what they wrote.  So since they supported it and that commitment is made to them, then I stand in support of this partners as well.  Thank you, Madam President.  Thank you, Alderman Moore.  And I can assure you that there was extensive engagement of the legacy IKEs residents by the CHA over many, many months.  There were tours over Don of the location, both for the school and the alternative site.  So I think that is the basis for the support that you referenced from the two letters.  Thank you.  Chair recognizes Alderman Martin.  Could you raise your hand? Yes.  I'd like to be recorded as voting no.  Thank you.  The chair recognizes, Alderman, let me go here first.  I'll call you last.  Alderman Taylor.  I'd like to be recorded as a no.  The chair recognizes Alderman Vasquez.  I'd also like to be recorded as a no.  Chair recognizes Alderman Chitra Lopez.  Thank you, I'd also like to be recorded as a no.  Any other folks before I call on Alderman Lee? The chair recognizes Alderman Lee.  Thank you, Madam President.  And to all of my colleagues, I rise in total support of this item.  I've been a lifelong resident of Chinatown and Bridgeport.
