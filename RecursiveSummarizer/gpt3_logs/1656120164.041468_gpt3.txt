Write a detailed summary of the following:

reach this conclusion. In his dissenting opinion, Justice Thomas wrote that the Court's previous decisions on abortion were "wholly without constitutional basis" and should be overturned. He argued that the Constitution does not protect a woman's right to an abortion, and that the Court's decisions on the matter had caused "profound damage to our constitutional order."  In 1973, the Supreme Court issued its Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion nationwide. The Court based its decision on a constitutional right to privacy, which it said included a woman's right to make decisions about her own body, including the decision to have an abortion. The Court also established a three-tiered system for regulating abortion, which placed different restrictions on abortion at different stages of pregnancy. Since Roe was decided, there has been a sharp divide in the United States over the issue of abortion. Those who support abortion rights have praised the decision as a victory for women's autonomy and privacy, while those who oppose abortion have criticized it as judicial overreach that has led to the taking of millions of innocent lives. In 1992, the Court revisited the issue of abortion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. The Court reaffirmed Roe's central holding that there is a constitutional right to abortion, but it rejected Roe's reasoning and instead grounded the right in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court also struck down several of the restrictions that had been placed on abortion under Roe, while upholding others. Since Casey was decided, the issue of abortion has remained highly divisive, with both sides continuing to argue passionately for their respective positions. The issue is likely to continue to be a contentious one in the years to come.  The U. S. Supreme Court's decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey significantly altered the legal landscape surrounding abortion. Prior to Casey, the Court's decision in Roe v. Wade had established a nationwide right to abortion, and had set up a three-tiered system whereby states could only regulate abortion in certain ways during specific periods of pregnancy. In Casey, however, the Court rejected Roe's trimester scheme and instead adopted a new and less clear "undue burden" test. Since its inception, Casey's "undue burden" test has proven to be difficult to apply in a consistent and predictable manner. This has led to a number of Circuit conflicts, as well as to the distortion of many important but unrelated legal doctrines. Moreover, Casey's recognition of a more intangible form of reliance on abortion has made it even more difficult to overturn. Despite these challenges, there are several good reasons to overturn Casey and return to the pre-Casey legal landscape. First, Casey's "undue burden" test is unworkable and has caused more confusion than clarity. Second, Casey has led to the distortion of many important legal doctrines, and these effects are cumulatively

RESPONSE:

In 1992, the Supreme Court issued its Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision, which significantly altered the legal landscape surrounding abortion. Prior to Casey, the Court's decision in Roe v. Wade had established a nationwide right to abortion, and had set up a three-tiered system whereby states could only regulate abortion in certain ways during specific periods of pregnancy. In Casey, however, the Court rejected Roe's trimester scheme and instead adopted a new and less clear "undue burden" test. Since its inception, Casey's "undue burden" test has proven to be difficult to apply in a consistent and predictable manner. This has led to a number of Circuit conflicts, as well as to the distortion of many important but unrelated legal doctrines. Moreover, Casey's recognition of a more intangible form of reliance on abortion has made it even more difficult to overturn. Despite these challenges, there are several good reasons to overturn Casey and return to the pre-Casey legal landscape. First, Casey's "undue burden" test is unworkable and has caused more confusion than clarity. Second, Casey has led to the distortion of many important legal doctrines, and these effects are cumulatively harmful to the rule of law. Finally, Casey's recognition of a reliance interest in abortion goes beyond what is constitutionally permissible, and thus provides yet another reason to overturn the decision.
