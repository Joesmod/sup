S., at 895, but there is obviously no clear line between a fraction that is large and one that is not. Nor is it clear what the Court meant by cases in which a regulation is relevant. These ambiguities have caused confusion and disagreement. Compare Whole Womans Health v. Hellerstedt, 579 U. S. 582, 627628 (2016), with id., at 666667, and n. 11 (ALITO, J., dissenting). 2 The difficulty of applying Caseys new rules surfaced in that very case. The controlling opinion found that Pennsylvanias 24-hour waiting period requirement and its informed-consent provision did not impose undue burden[s], Casey, 505 U. S., at 881887, but Justice Stevens, applying the same test, reached the opposite result, id., at 920922 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). That did not bode well, and then-Chief Justice Rehnquist aptly observed that the undue burden standard presents nothing more workable than the trimester framework. Id., at 964966 (dissenting opinion). The ambiguity of the undue burden test also produced disagreement in later cases.

This Courts experience applying Casey has confirmed Chief Justice Rehnquists prescient diagnosis that the undue-burden standard was not built to last. Casey, 505 U.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Casey decision created an ambiguous "undue burden" test for abortion regulations, which has caused confusion and disagreement among lower courts. This has been especially evident in the Whole Woman's Health and June Medical cases. The "undue burden" test is difficult to apply and has resulted in different outcomes in similar cases.
