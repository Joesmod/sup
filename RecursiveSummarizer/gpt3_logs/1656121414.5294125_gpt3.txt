CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

This is a discussion of the history of abortion law and whether or not there is a constitutional right to abortion. The author reviews scholarship on the topic and finds it lacking. He then looks at the history of abortion law and finds that while many states criminalized abortion after quickening, there was no universal consensus on when abortion should be criminalized. The author concludes that there is no clear constitutional right to abortion.
