Write a concise summary of the following:

substantial obstacle to women seeking abortions.  The Casey decision created an ambiguous "undue burden" test for abortion regulations, which has caused confusion and disagreement among lower courts. This has been especially evident in the Whole Woman's Health and June Medical cases. The "undue burden" test is difficult to apply and has resulted in different outcomes in similar cases.  The Court of Appeals has experienced difficulty in applying the large-fraction-of-relevant-cases test to restrictions on abortion. They have criticized the assignment while reaching unpredictable results. And they have candidly outlined Caseys many other problems.  The Court's abortion cases have been problematic, to say the least. They have led to the distortion of many important but unrelated legal doctrines, and that effect provides further support for overruling those decisions. Members of this Court have repeatedly lamented that no legal rule or doctrine is safe from ad hoc nullification by this Court when an occasion for its application arises in a case involving state regulation of abortion. The continued adherence to the current standard would undermine, not advance, the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles.  The Court in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization (2020) considered whether to overturn Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood, which established a woman's right to an abortion. The Court found that there were no conventional reliance interests at stake, as getting an abortion is generally unplanned. The Court also found that the ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives. Ultimately, the Court declined to overturn Roe and Casey.  The Supreme Court has ruled that the notion of reliance on Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood is not supported by previous cases, which instead focus on more concrete interests like property rights and contract law. The Court also found that it is difficult to assess the impact of abortion on society and women's lives, and that it is not the role of the judiciary to weigh the relative importance of the fetus and the mother.  The Supreme Court has ruled that abortion is a constitutional right, and that this right cannot be overruled by public opinion. The Court emphasized that its decision only concerns the right to abortion, and not any other right.  In overruling Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Supreme Court has ruled that there is no constitutional right to an abortion. This does not end debate on the issue, but simply returns it to the people and their elected representatives.  The majority opinion in this case holds that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion, overruling Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood. The dissent argues that the majority has abandoned stare decisis, but the majority maintains that they have
