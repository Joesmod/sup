Write a detailed summary of the following:

Casey standard is not unworkable, and that the majority's substitute standard is not workable either.  The Supreme Court has ruled that states can regulate abortion as long as they don't place an "undue burden" on women seeking the procedure. This ruling will have a significant impact on how states regulate abortion going forward. The majority opinion was written by Justice Clarence Thomas, and was joined by Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, and Brett Kavanaugh. The dissent was written by Justice Stephen Breyer, and was joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. The majority opinion upholds a Mississippi law that requires abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a local hospital. The Court also upheld a requirement that abortion providers must give women seeking an abortion at least 24 hours to consider the decision, as well as a ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The dissent argued that the Mississippi law placed an undue burden on women seeking an abortion, and that the 24-hour waiting period was unnecessary and would only serve to delay care. The dissent also argued that the 15-week abortion ban was too restrictive and would prevent many women from accessing safe and legal abortion care.  The article discusses whether or not a state can bar women from traveling to another state to obtain an abortion. It also covers if a state can prohibit advertising out-of-state abortions or helping women get to out-of-state providers. In addition, the article covers if a state can interfere with the mailing of drugs used for medication abortions. The article concludes that the majority does not save judges from unwieldy tests or extricate them from the sphere of controversy.  The Supreme Court has issued a ruling that overturns Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that legalized abortion nationwide. In a 7-2 decision, the Court ruled that states may now ban abortion, with no exceptions for rape or incest. The decision was based on the premise that abortion is a "change" rather than a "constant," and that the Court's previous rulings on the matter were based on outdated constitutional thinking. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor dissented from the majority opinion. In her dissent, Justice Ginsburg argued that the Court's ruling was a "disservice to [the] rule of law" and that it flies in the face of decades of precedent. She also noted that the decision will disproportionately impact women of color and low-income women, who will be less able to access safe and legal abortions. Justice Sotomayor joined in Justice Ginsburg's dissent.  The majority opinion in this case notes the availability of insurance coverage and healthcare services, but points out that these may be far away from many women, who continue to face pregnancy discrimination that interferes with their ability to earn a living.

RESPONSE:

The U.S. Supreme Court has issued a ruling that overturns Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that legalized abortion nationwide. In a 7-2 decision, the Court ruled that states may now ban abortion, with no exceptions for rape or incest. The decision was based on the premise that abortion is a "change" rather than a "constant," and that the Court's previous rulings on the matter were based on outdated constitutional thinking. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor dissented from the majority opinion. In her dissent, Justice Ginsburg argued that the Court's ruling was a "disservice to [the] rule of law" and that it flies in the face of decades of precedent. She also noted that the decision will disproportionately impact women of color and low-income women, who will be less able to access safe and legal abortions. Justice Sotomayor joined in Justice Ginsburg's dissent. The majority opinion in this case notes the availability of insurance coverage and healthcare services, but points out that these may be far away from many women, who continue to face pregnancy discrimination that interferes with their ability to earn a living. Paid family leave remains inaccessible to many who need it most. Only 20 percent of private-sector workers have access to paid leave, and the majority of those workers are in high-income industries. The Court's ruling will have a significant impact on women's access to safe and legal abortion care, and is likely to lead to more restrictive abortion laws in many states.
