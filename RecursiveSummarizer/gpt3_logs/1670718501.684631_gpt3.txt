Write an explanation of the following and how it is a waste of the City's money:


part of that if it's an ongoing effort because I'm assuming there will be some policy initiatives that come out of that and having a representative from the housing community that's not me but somebody else I think would be helpful in moving that whatever those policy recommendations are coming out of that important work.  Questions of members of the committee? All of them in the spot.  I didn't even have to raise my hand.  That is some proactive asking.  I love it.  Thank you very much, chair.
