abortion right from other rights that have been recognized by the Court.  The article discusses employment protections for workers who are pregnant or nursing. It notes that 46 states and the District of Columbia have employment protections against pregnancy discrimination. The article also discusses the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which guarantees employment leave for pregnancy and birth, as well as the Affordable Care Act, which requires certain health benefits for pregnant women. Finally, the article notes that all 50 states and the District of Columbia have enacted safe haven laws, which allow women to anonymously drop off babies, and that the demand for adoptions has increased in recent years.  The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that there is no constitutional right to abortion, and that the power to regulate abortion lies with the people and their elected representatives.  The dissent in the abortion case cannot argue that the abortion right is rooted in this nation's history and tradition, and instead relies on the fact that a constitutional right to abortion was recognized in Roe and later decisions. However, the court overrules Roe, finding that there is no support in history or precedent for the decision. The court also finds that the state has a legitimate interest in protecting fetal life.  The Supreme Court has ruled that the right to same-sex marriage is protected by the Constitution, in a decision that strikes down state bans on such unions. The court's ruling is based on the principle of stare decisis, which holds that past decisions should be respected. This principle protects the interests of those who have taken action in reliance on past decisions, reduces incentives for challenging settled precedents, and fosters evenhanded decisionmaking.  The U.S. Supreme Court has long recognized that the doctrine of stare decisis is not an inexorable command, and that it is at its weakest when interpreting the Constitution. The Court has also acknowledged that an erroneous constitutional decision can be corrected by amending the Constitution, but that this is notoriously difficult to do. Therefore, in appropriate circumstances, the Court must be willing to reconsider and, if necessary, overrule constitutional decisions.  This Court has overruled important constitutional decisions on many occasions. In West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 597 (1943), the Court overruled Minersville School Dist. v. Gobitis, 310 U. S. 586 (1940), and held that public school students could not be compelled to salute the flag in violation of their sincere beliefs. On many other occasions, this Court has overruled important constitutional decisions.  The Supreme Court has overruled a number of previous decisions, including National League of Cities v. Usery (rejecting the principle that the Commerce Clause does not empower Congress to enforce requirements, such as minimum wage laws, against the States in areas of traditional governmental
