Write a concise summary of the following:

majoritys declaration that two Courts got the result egregiously wrong? And to justify that action by reference to Barnette? Or to Browna case in which the Chief Justice also wrote an (11-page) opinion in which the entire Court could speak with one voice? These questions answer themselves. Casey itself addressed both West Coast Hotel and Brown, and found that neither supported Roes overruling. In West Coast Hotel, Casey explained, the facts of economic life had proved different from those previously assumed. 505 U. S., at 862. And even though Plessy was wrong the day it was decided, the passage of time had made that ever more clear to ever more citizens: Societys understanding of the facts in 1954 was fundamentally different than in 1896. Id., at 863. So the Court needed to reverse course. In constitutional adjudication as elsewhere in life, changed circumstances may impose new obligations. Id., at 864. And because such dramatic change had occurred, the public could understand why the Court was acting. [T]he Nation could accept each decision as a response to the Courts constitutional duty. Ibid. But that would not be true of a reversal of Roe[b]ecause neither the factual underpinnings of Roes central holding nor our understanding of it has changed. 505 U. S., at 864. That is just as much so today, because Roe and Casey continue to reflect, not diverge from, broad trends in American society. It is, of course, true that many Americans, including many women, opposed those decisions when issued and do so now as well. Yet the fact remains: Roe and Casey were the product of a profound and ongoing change in womens roles in the latter part of the 20th century. Only a dozen years before Roe, the Court described women as the center  Cite as: 597 U.

Florida, 368 U. S. 57, 62 (1961). By 1973, when the Court decided Roe, fundamental social change was underway regarding the place of womenand the law had begun to follow. See Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S. 71, 76 (1971) (recognizing that the Equal Protection Clause prohibits sex-based discrimination). By 1992, when the Court decided Casey, the traditional view of a womans role as only a wife and mother was no longer consistent with our understanding of the family, the individual, or the Constitution. 505 U. S., at 897; see supra, at 15, 2324. Under that charter, Casey understood, women must take their place as full and equal citizens. And for that to happen, women must have control over their reproductive decisions. Nothing since Caseyno changed law, no changed facthas undermined that promise.

The Court adheres to precedent not just for institutional reasons, but

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The majority opinion in the case at hand declares that two previous court cases were decided erroneously, and cites the Barnette and Brown cases as justification for their decision. The Barnette case involved the Chief Justice writing an opinion in which the entire court could speak with one voice, and the Brown case reversed a previous decision. The majority opinion in the current case finds that neither of these cases support the overruling of Roe v. Wade, and that the Roe decision was based on changed circumstances and public understanding of the issue at the time. The dissenting opinion argues that nothing has changed since Roe was decided that would justify overturning it, and that doing so would create an overwhelming burden for those who have come to rely on it.
