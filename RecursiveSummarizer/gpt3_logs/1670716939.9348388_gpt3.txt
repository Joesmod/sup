towards that gross receipt, which in turn would allow for the MBE or WB entity to do a little bit more work within the new parameters that we're putting forward? Well, that's an interesting idea.  I want to maybe give that little thought.  My first instinct is that this will be an accounting nightmare for the certification people, because that means you're going to have to go contract by contract about what you're going to count.  And certification already takes too long and people complain it's too complicated.  But if I have to look at every year, every single contract you had and try to figure out what dollars you kept versus what dollars you subbed, whether your subs were MBEs or not, I'm not sure ultimately, but that would quickly collapse under its own way.  I guess the other concern that I would have is that this might be viewed as a set aside or some type of a rigid preference for minority firms, because majority firms, their gross receipts count against them.  And for some of them are in some small business programs, and especially the city expands its race neutral prime contracting programs.  But my first instinct is that from an accounting and compliance standpoint, that this is just way, way too complicated.  But I'm happy to give it some thought because nobody's ever suggested that to me before.  So at least that's a very interesting idea.  Okay, and then, sorry, Mr.  Chairman, I just had one more.  Please, please go ahead.  The engineers and architects, they are in a separate ordinance.  Could we increase their gross receipts and personal net worth, or does a disparity study need to happen first before we do that? Oh, you absolutely have to have a study.  We can't just take a leap from guys that pour concrete to the architects.  And so that really is a separate research project.  And I don't even know whether or not there are many firms that are outside of construction, have had issues with this.  I just don't know because I didn't study that.  So I

RESPONSE:

The idea being discussed is that MBE and WB entities would be able to do more work if their gross receipts were counted towards the total amount of the contract, rather than just the work they do themselves. The concern is that this would be too complicated to keep track of and might be seen as preferential treatment for minority-owned businesses. It is also noted that a similar change would have to be made for engineers and architects, but that a study would need to be done first to see if there is a need for it.
