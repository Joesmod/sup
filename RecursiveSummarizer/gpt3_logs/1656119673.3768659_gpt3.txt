disputed ground. It understood that different people’s “experiences,” “values,” and “religious training” and beliefs led to “opposing views” about abortion. 410 U. S., at 116. But by a 7-to-2 vote, the Court held that in the earlier stages of pregnancy, that contested and contestable choice must belong to a woman, in consultation with her family and doctor. The Court explained that a long line of precedents, “founded in the Fourteenth Amendment’s concept of personal liberty,” protected individual decisionmaking related to “marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, and child rearing and education.” Id., at 152–153 (citations omitted). For the same reasons, the Court held, the Constitution must protect “a woman’s decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.” Id., at 153. The Court recognized the myriad ways bearing a child can alter the “life and future” of a woman and other    8 DOBBS v.

A State could not, “by adopting one theory of life,” override all “rights of the pregnant woman.” Id., at 162. At the same time, though, the Court recognized “valid interest[s]” of the State “in regulating the abortion decision.” Id., at 153. The Court noted in particular “important interests” in “protecting potential life,” “maintaining medical standards,” and “safeguarding [the] health” of the woman. Id., at 154. No “absolut[ist]” account of the woman’s right could wipe away those significant state claims. Ibid. The Court therefore struck a balance, turning on the stage of the pregnancy at which the abortion would occur. The Court explained that early on, a woman’s choice must prevail, but that “at some point the state interests” become “dominant.” Id., at 155. It then set some guideposts. In the first trimester of pregnancy, the State could not interfere at all with the decision to terminate a pregnancy. At any time after that point, the State could regulate to protect the pregnant woman’s health, such as by insisting that abortion providers and facilities meet safety requirements. And after the fetus’s viability—the point when the fetus “has the capability of meaningful life outside the mother’s womb”—the State could ban abortions, except when necessary to preserve the woman’s life or health. Id., at 163–164. In the 20 years between Roe and Casey, the Court expressly reaffirmed Roe on two occasions, and applied it on many more.

DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

In the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of a Mississippi law that would ban abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The Court struck down the law by a 7-to-2 vote, holding that in the earlier stages of pregnancy, the choice of whether or not to have an abortion must belong to the woman, in consultation with her family and doctor. The Court explained that a long line of precedents, including the right to privacy, protected individual decisionmaking related to abortion. The Court also recognized the valid interests of the state in regulating abortion, such as protecting potential life, maintaining medical standards, and safeguarding the health of the woman. However, the Court held that these interests must yield to the woman's right to choose in the first trimester of pregnancy. After the first trimester, the state may regulate to protect the woman's health, and after viability, the state may ban abortion except when necessary to preserve the woman's life or health.
