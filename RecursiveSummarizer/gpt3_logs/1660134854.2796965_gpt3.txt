RESPONSE:

The graph indicates that enrollees in a prescription drug plan or an MAPD plan have the option to make an election prior to the beginning of the plan year or in any month during the plan year. PDP sponsors and MA organizations are responsible for informing enrollees of the option to make such an election and ensuring that enrollees are aware of the option when they incur out-of-pocket costs with respect to covered part D drugs. If an enrollee fails to pay the amount billed, the PDP sponsor or MA organization must have a financial reconciliation process in place to correct any inaccuracies in payments made by the enrollee during the plan year.
