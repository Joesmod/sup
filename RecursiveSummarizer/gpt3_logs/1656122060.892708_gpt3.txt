protecting fetal life. Sonograms became widely used in the 1970s, long before Casey. Today, 60 percent of women seeking abortions have at least one child, and one-third have two or more. These women know, even as they choose to have an abortion, what it is to look at a sonogram image and to value a fetal life.  The dissent argues that the majority's decision will harm women's health, especially in states with restrictive abortion policies. They point to data showing that carrying a pregnancy to term is much more dangerous than having an abortion, and that states with restrictive abortion policies tend to invest less in women's and children's health. They also argue that the global trend is toward increased access to legal and safe abortion care, and that the United States is now an outlier in its restrictions on abortion.  In the past 25 years, abortion laws have been liberalized worldwide. American States will become international outliers after today. The majority can point to neither legal nor factual developments in support of its decision. Roe and Casey continue to be accurate in their assessment that a woman, not the government, should choose whether she will bear the burdens of pregnancy, childbirth, and parenting.  The Supreme Court overruled Plessy v. Ferguson, which had allowed for "separate but equal" public facilities for black and white citizens. The Court held that this policy was unconstitutional, as it violated the Reconstruction Amendments guaranteeing full citizenship for former slaves. The Court also noted that segregation could never be consistent with the Amendments, and that it had detrimental effects on children's hearts and minds.  The majority opinion in the case at hand declares that two previous court cases were decided erroneously, and cites the Barnette and Brown cases as justification for their decision. The Barnette case involved the Chief Justice writing an opinion in which the entire court could speak with one voice, and the Brown case reversed a previous decision. The majority opinion in the current case finds that neither of these cases support the overruling of Roe v. Wade, and that the Roe decision was based on changed circumstances and public understanding of the issue at the time. The dissenting opinion argues that nothing has changed since Roe was decided that would justify overturning it, and that doing so would create an overwhelming burden for those who have come to rely on it.  The majority opinion in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization lacks any discussion of how its ruling will affect women. This is despite the fact that the Court observed in Casey v. Planned Parenthood that individuals have organized their lives around the availability of abortion for over two decades. The majority's refusal to face the facts about how its ruling will impact women reveals a lack of understanding or concern for their lives and the suffering its decision will cause.  The Supreme Court's decision to
