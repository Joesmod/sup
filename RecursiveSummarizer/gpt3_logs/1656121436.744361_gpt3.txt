Write a concise summary of the following:

a century after 1868including another half-century after women gained the constitutional right to vote in 1920, see post, at 15; Amdt. 19it was firmly established that laws prohibiting abortion like the Texas law at issue in Roe were permissible exercises of state regulatory authority. And today, another half century later, more than half of the States have asked us to overrule Roe and Casey. The dissent cannot establish that a right to abortion has ever been part of this Nations tradition. 2 Because the dissent cannot argue that the abortion right is rooted in this Nations history and tradition, it contends that the constitutional tradition is not captured whole at a single moment, and that its meaning gains content from the long sweep of our history and from successive judicial precedents. Post, at 18 (internal quotation marks omitted). This vague formulation imposes no clear restraints on what Justice White called the exercise of raw judicial power, Roe, 410 U. S., at 222 (dissenting opinion), and while the dissent claims that its standard does not mean Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 37 Opinion of the Court anything goes, post, at 17, any real restraints are hard to discern. The largely limitless reach of the dissenters standard is illustrated by the way they apply it here. First, if the long sweep of history imposes any restraint on the recognition of unenumerated rights, then Roe was surely wrong, since abortion was never allowed (except to save the life of the mother) in a majority of States for over 100 years before that decision was handed down. Second, it is impossible to defend Roe based on prior precedent because all of the precedents Roe cited, including Griswold and Eisenstadt, were critically different for a reason that we have explained: None of those cases involved the destruction of what Roe called potential life. See supra, at 32. So without support in history or relevant precedent, Roes reasoning cannot be defended even under the dissents proposed test, and the dissent is forced to rely solely on the fact that a constitutional right to abortion was recognized in Roe and later decisions that accepted Roes interpretation. Under the doctrine of stare decisis, those precedents are entitled to careful and respectful consideration, and we engage in that analysis below. But as the Court has reiterated time and time again, adherence to precedent is not an inexorable command. Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment, LLC, 576 U. S. 446, 455 (2015). There are occasions when past decisions should be overruled, and as we will explain, this is one of them. 3 The most striking feature of the dissent is the absence of any serious discussion of the legitimacy of the States interest in protecting fetal life. This is evident in the analogy that the dissent draws between the abortion right and the rights recognized in Griswold (contraception), Eisenstadt (same), Lawrence (sexual conduct with member of the same sex), and

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The dissent in the abortion case cannot argue that the abortion right is rooted in this nation's history and tradition, and instead relies on the fact that a constitutional right to abortion was recognized in Roe and later decisions. However, the court overrules Roe, finding that there is no support in history or precedent for the decision. The court also finds that the state has a legitimate interest in protecting fetal life.
