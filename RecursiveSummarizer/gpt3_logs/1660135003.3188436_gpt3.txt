CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 amends the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to include a new section 45Q, which provides a tax credit for the capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide emissions from certain electric generating units. The credit is available for units that are originally placed in service more than 1 year prior to the date on which construction of the carbon capture equipment begins, and on or after the date which is 3 years prior to the date on which construction of such equipment begins. The credit is also available for units that are originally placed in service more than 3 years prior to the date on which construction of the carbon capture equipment begins, but only for the 3 years with the highest annual carbon oxide production during the 12-year period preceding the date on which construction of such equipment begins.
