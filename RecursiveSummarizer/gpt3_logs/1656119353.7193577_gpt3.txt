DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

In 1861, the Territory of Colorado enacted a law criminalizing abortion. The law provided that any person who administered or caused to be administered any medicinal substance, or used any instruments, with the intention of procuring a miscarriage, would be guilty of manslaughter and subject to punishment accordingly. In 1863-1864, the Territory of Idaho enacted a similar law, criminalizing abortion and providing for a punishment of imprisonment for a term of not less than two years nor more than five years. Montana enacted a similar law in 1864, and Arizona in 1865. Wyoming enacted a similar law in 1869.
