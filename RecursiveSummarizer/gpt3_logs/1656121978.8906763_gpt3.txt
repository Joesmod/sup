Write a concise summary of the following:

The Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade and ruled that the Constitution does not confer a right to abortion. This ruling returns the authority to regulate abortion to the people and their elected representatives.  The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the right to obtain an abortion is not a constitutional right, and that regulations and prohibitions of abortion are governed by the same standard of review as other health and safety measures.  The Supreme Court has previously recognized a right to privacy which includes the right to have an abortion, but this right is not mentioned in the Constitution. The history of abortion shows that it has long been considered a crime, but there has been a wave of statutory restrictions in recent years. The Court has applied a standard in determining whether an asserted right is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Solicitor General suggests that history supports an abortion right. However, the history of abortion does not necessarily mean that everyone thought the States lacked the authority to criminalize it. Instead of seriously pressing the argument that the abortion right itself has deep roots, supporters of Roe and Casey contend that the abortion right is an integral part of a broader entrenched right.  The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that there is no right to abortion enshrined in the Constitution. This overturns the previous rulings in Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood, which had found such a right. The Court found that abortion is different from other issues because it involves the destruction of human life, and that precedent does not support the right to abortion. The Court also ruled that the doctrine of stare decisis does not require the continued acceptance of Roe and Casey, and that there are strong reasons to overturn those decisions.  The Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade has been highly controversial since it was issued in 1973. The Court's reasoning in the case has been criticized for being overly simplistic and for failing to adequately justify the distinction between pre- and post-viability abortions. In 1992, the Court revisited the case in Planned Parenthood v. Casey and reaffirmed Roe's central holding, but declined to endorse its reasoning.  The controlling opinion in the case of Casey v. Planned Parenthood criticized and rejected Roe v. Wade's trimester scheme, and substituted a new and obscure "undue burden" test. This new test has proved to be unworkable, leading to a long list of Circuit conflicts. Additionally, Roe and Casey have led to the distortion of many important but unrelated legal doctrines. Finally, traditional reliance interests are not implicated by an overturn of Roe and Casey because getting an abortion is generally unplanned activity.  The Supreme Court has ruled that states can regulate abortion for legitimate reasons, and that such regulations are entitled to a strong presumption of validity. In this case, the Court
