Write a concise summary of the following:


foot.  All of the last will be resolved to our speed.  So Lawndale Avenue will be the site of six new family homes, the last in blue with the blue house will get the new house and if you look at the top here you'll see the sort of house that Tim is planning and putting them Ridgway is also getting six new single family homes.  Ohio Street will be the site of five new single family homes to will be on here and and two more on Monticello.  On a double that each will be about 1450 square feet.  There's a rear bedroom on the ground floor and two bedrooms, one on either end, and a family room on the second floor.  There are two typical facade reversing brick and hardy board components for the base and here it has at least eight facade options so that repetition can be avoided on the streetscape.  There are three more facade offerings.  And this is a front and rear rendering of a single family home.  You can see the, there's no rear entrance to the second entrance is on the side.  So this concludes my testimony.  After any questions Mr Swanson or I can attempt to answer as you view a short video hopefully this will work.  But it means bring modular housing to Chicago.  How short Brian is it.  It's just like a minute.  Okay.  It's interesting to see and it's very, very complicated.  Do you have a smile on your face I'm assuming that you think that this will be the wave of the future to fill some of the vacant land we have in our community for quality housing.  Yeah, I think as an arrow we need to have in our quiver at least.  People can be working all winter long and building these, and then when the, when spring comes they can ship them out to the last while we watch the end of the video if I can ask you and Mr.  Swanson, Swanson.  In a very serious note, is this something that if this works well with these sites that you're acquiring that you or other companies who are doing the work similar can do this of scale at a larger level of homes.  So thank you very much.  Thank


CONCISE SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

The city of Chicago is planning to build six new single-family homes on Lawndale Avenue, five new single-family homes on Ohio Street, and two more on Monticello. The homes will be modular, meaning they will be built in a factory and then shipped to the site. This should help to speed up the construction process and create quality housing for the community.
