Write a concise summary of the following:


identified in the bid that they must meet in order to be qualified as a responsible bidder? Meaning whatever we said it was required for them to submit as part of their proposal must have been submitted at the time the proposal was due.  As to incentives, I will turn that over to Jackie to explain the incentives.  If there are any related to JOC.  Jackie.  I'm here, I'm here.  In all of our bids solicitations, we put a list of bid incentives.  Now, if the contractor took those bid incentives, I would have to get that information to you through the chair, because I don't have that information right now readily available.  But they were available just as they would be on any solicitation the city would have.  Correct, we put a list of bid incentives in all of our bid solicitations, correct.  Okay, and were any of these done through the small SBI or MBI? No.  Okay.  And is that a decision made by procurement or by the department? If something goes SBI or MBI? It is a decision made by the department.  It's a recommendation made by the department with confirmation with DPS, but SBI or MBI is really determined by the dollar amount as well.  All right.  The contract value.  All right.  Chairman Dow.  That was my question, Chairman Berman, about the SBI.  I wanted to ask AIS if they've considered that to run parallel with these contracts, these JOC contracts.  Is this something that they're looking at? Also, I think the same question I would give to Tom Carney at CDOT.  And then from procurement, I'm curious to know what the upper limit is or the maximum contract value is for those programs, if those have changed.  Lastly, it's responsive and responsible.  Okay.  I can answer the chairman's question with regards to CDOT.  Go ahead, Tom.  So this goes back a bit.  So in the planning phase of this and figuring out the nature of the work and some of the contract values did kind of push it out of the SBI, MBI.  We had contemplated after awarding these, then trying to go JOC,
