abortion rights going forward, as it could open the door for more restrictive laws to be passed at the state level.  The Supreme Court has struck down a Louisiana law that would have required abortion providers to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, in a split 5-4 decision. The Louisiana law was similar to a Texas law that the Court had struck down in 2016, and the Court's decision today reaffirms that the 2016 decision was correct. In his opinion for the Court, Justice Breyer wrote that the Louisiana law "would place a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking an abortion," and that there was no evidence that the law would actually improve the safety of abortion. Justice Thomas, in a concurring opinion, wrote that the Court should have gone further and overruled its previous decisions establishing a constitutional right to abortion. Justice Ginsburg, in a dissenting opinion, wrote that the Court should have struck down the Louisiana law without even considering its constitutionality, because the law was "a disguised attempt to shutter abortion clinics."  The Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution protects a woman's right to have an abortion, but this right is not absolute. States are allowed to regulate abortion in certain ways, such as requiring parental consent for minors or banning so-called "partial-birth" abortions. In the case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Court upheld a Pennsylvania law that placed several restrictions on abortion, including a 24-hour waiting period and mandatory parental consent for minors. The Court's ruling in Casey was based on the principle of stare decisis, or the principle that precedent should be followed. The Court specifically noted that its decision in Roe v. Wade, which first established the constitutional right to abortion, was still good law. However, the Court also said that Roe was not "inviolate," and that states could place certain restrictions on abortion as long as those restrictions did not place an "undue burden" on a woman's right to choose. The Court's ruling in Casey was controversial, and it was immediately challenged. In the case of Gonzales v. Carhart, the Court considered a challenge to the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003. The Court upheld the law, ruling that it did not place an undue burden on a woman's right to choose. In the present case, the Court is considering a challenge to a Mississippi law that would ban abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with no exceptions for rape, incest, or health of the mother. The law does make an exception for cases where the pregnancy poses a "substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function." The Court has two options: it can either uphold the Mississippi law, or it can strike it down.
