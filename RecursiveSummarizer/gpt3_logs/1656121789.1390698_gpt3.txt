But here is the rub. The law also did not then (and would not for ages) protect a wealth of other things. It did not protect the rights recognized in Lawrence and Obergefell to same-sex intimacy and marriage. It did not protect the right recognized in Loving to marry across racial lines. It did not protect the right recognized in Griswold to contraceptive use. For that matter, it did not protect the right recognized in Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U. S. 535 (1942), not to be sterilized without consent. So if the majority is right in its legal analysis, all those decisions were wrong, and all those matters properly belong to the States toowhatever the particular state interests involved.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution does not protect a woman's right to choose an abortion, and that abortion bans are therefore constitutionally mandated. This decision overturns a number of previous decisions, including those recognizing the rights to same-sex intimacy and marriage, to marry across racial lines, and to use contraception. The Court's decision is based on the idea that the law in the 19th century did not protect a woman's right to choose an abortion, and that this right therefore does not implicate liberty. However, the Court's reasoning provides no way to distinguish between the right to choose an abortion and other rights, including those recognized in previous decisions. As a result, the Court's decision threatens a number of other constitutional rights.
