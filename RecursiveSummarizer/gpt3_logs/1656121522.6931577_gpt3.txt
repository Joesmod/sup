unconstitutionality.64 And they have distorted First Amendment doctrines.65 When vindicating a doctrinal innovation requires courts to engineer exceptions to longstanding background rules, the doctrine has failed to deliver the principled and intelligible development of the law that stare decisis purports to secure.

We last consider whether overruling Roe and Casey will upend substantial reliance interests.  60Compare United States v. Salerno, 481 U. S. 739, 745 (1987), with Casey, 505 U. S., at 895; see also supra, at 5659. 61Compare Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 499 (1975), and Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U. S. 1, 15, 1718 (2004), with June Medical, 591 U.

S., at ___ (opinion of KAVANAUGH, J.) (slip op., at 15); Janus, 585 U. S., at ______ (slip op., at 34 35). 1 Traditional reliance interests arise where advance planning of great precision is most obviously a necessity. Casey, 505 U. S., at 856 (joint opinion); see also Payne, 501 U. S., at 828. In Casey, the controlling opinion conceded that those traditional reliance interests were not implicated because getting an abortion is generally unplanned activity, and reproductive planning could take virtually immediate account of any sudden restoration of state authority to ban abortions. 505 U. S., at 856. For these reasons, we agree with the Casey plurality that conventional, concrete reliance interests are not present here. 2 Unable to find reliance in the conventional sense, the controlling opinion in Casey perceived a more intangible form of reliance. It wrote that people [had] organized intimate relationships and made choices that define their views of themselves and their places in society . . . in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail and that [t]he ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives. Ibid. But this Court is ill-equipped to assess generalized assertions about the national psyche. Id., at 957 (opinion of Rehnquist, C. J.). Caseys

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Court in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization (2020) considered whether to overturn Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood, which established a woman's right to an abortion. The Court found that there were no conventional reliance interests at stake, as getting an abortion is generally unplanned. The Court also found that the ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the Nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives. Ultimately, the Court declined to overturn Roe and Casey.
