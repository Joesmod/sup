CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

This section of the bill deals with rebates for Part B drugs. Part B rebatable drugs are defined as single-source drugs or biologicals (including biosimilar products) for which payment is made under Part B, with the exception of vaccines or drugs/biologicals for which the average total allowed charges per year per individual user is less than $100 (as adjusted for inflation). For each Part B rebatable drug, manufacturers must provide the Secretary with information on the drug's price and market share, and must pay a rebate equal to the difference between the price of the drug and its benchmark price, as specified in the bill. There is a transition rule for reporting in 2023 and 2024, and the Secretary is authorized to delay the timeframe for reporting until 2025.
