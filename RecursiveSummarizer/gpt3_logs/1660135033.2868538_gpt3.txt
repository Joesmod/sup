The Inflation Adjustment Factor for the calendar year in which the sale occurs is determined under section 2 45(e)(2), as applied by substituting calendar year 3 2023 for calendar year 1992 in subparagraph (B) 4 thereof. If the 0.3 cent amount as increased under this paragraph is not a multiple of 0.05 cent, such amount 7 shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of 0.05 cent. 8 If the 2.5 cent amount as increased under this paragraph is not a multiple of 0.1 cent, such amount shall 10 be rounded to the nearest multiple of 0.1 cent. 11 The credit determined under subsection (a) shall be increased by 5 times for any qualified nuclear power facility which satisfies the requirements of paragraph (2)(A), which are that the taxpayer shall ensure that any laborers and mechanics employed by the taxpayer or any contractor or subcontractor in the alteration or repair of such facility shall be paid wages at rates not less than the prevailing rates for alteration or repair of a similar character in the locality in which such facility is located as most recently determined by the Secretary of Labor, in accordance with subchapter IV of chapter 31 of title 40, United States Code.
