Write a detailed summary of the following:

constitutional “right of personal privacy,” id., at 152, but it conflated two very different meanings of the term: the right Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 49 Opinion of the Court to shield information from disclosure and the right to make and implement important personal decisions without governmental interference. See Whalen v. Roe, 429 U. S. 589, 599–600 (1977). Only the cases involving this second sense of the term could have any possible relevance to the abortion issue, and some of the cases in that category involved personal decisions that were obviously very, very far afield. See Pierce, 268 U. S. 510 (right to send children to religious school); Meyer, 262 U. S. 390 (right to have children receive German language instruction). What remained was a handful of cases having something to do with marriage, Loving, 388 U. S. 1 (right to marry a person of a different race), or procreation, Skinner, 316 U. S. 535 (right not to be sterilized); Griswold, 381 U. S. 479 (right of married persons to obtain contraceptives); Eisenstadt, 405 U. S. 438 (same, for unmarried persons). But none of these decisions involved what is distinctive about abortion: its effect on what Roe termed “potential life.” When the Court summarized the basis for the scheme it imposed on the country, it asserted that its rules were “consistent with” the following: (1) “the relative weights of the respective interests involved,” (2) “the lessons and examples of medical and legal history,” (3) “the lenity of the common law,” and (4) “the demands of the profound problems of the present day.” Roe, 410 U. S., at 165. Put aside the second and third factors, which were based on the Court’s flawed account of history, and what remains are precisely the sort of considerations that legislative bodies often take into account when they draw lines that accommodate competing interests. The scheme Roe produced looked like legislation, and the Court provided the sort of explanation that might be expected from a legislative body. c What Roe did not provide was any cogent justification for the lines it drew. Why, for example, does a State have no    50 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court authority to regulate first trimester abortions for the purpose of protecting a woman’s health? The Court’s only explanation was that mortality rates for abortion at that stage were lower than the mortality rates for childbirth. Id., at 163. But the Court did not explain why mortality rates were the only factor that a State could legitimately consider. Many health and safety regulations aim to avoid adverse health consequences short of death. And the Court did not explain why it departed from the normal rule that courts defer to the judgments of legislatures “in areas fraught with medical and scientific uncertainties.” Marshall v. United States, 414 U. S. 417, 427 (1974). An even more glaring deficiency was Roe’s failure to justify the critical distinction it drew between pre- and

DETAILED SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

The constitutional "right of personal privacy" protects the right to make important personal decisions without government interference. This right was first recognized in the case of Griswold v. Connecticut, which invalidated a state law prohibiting the use of contraceptives. The right was extended to unmarried persons in Eisenstadt v. Baird, and to abortion in Roe v. Wade. Roe held that states could not ban abortion outright, but could place restrictions on the procedure during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy. The Court reasoned that the state's interest in protecting the health of the mother outweighed the interests of the fetus during the first trimester, but that the state's interest in protecting the life of the fetus became increasingly compelling as the pregnancy progressed. The Court's reasoning in Roe has been criticized for its failure to justify the distinction it drew between pre- and post-viability abortions. The Court has also been criticized for its deference to the judgments of legislatures in areas where there is scientific uncertainty.
