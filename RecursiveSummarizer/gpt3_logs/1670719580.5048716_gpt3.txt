What you're basically saying is, in our Ollie's Barbecue case, the company there said, I'll serve blacks but only on a takeout window, not inside my restaurant because that sends a message that I endorse integration.

RESPONSE:

The lawyer for a Colorado baker who refused to make a cake for a gay couple's wedding argues that her client's actions are protected speech under the First Amendment. Justice Sotomayor points out that the baker is essentially saying that she does not want to serve gay couples, just as a restaurant in a previous case said it did not want to serve black people. The lawyer argues that the baker is not trying to send a message through her conduct, but Justice Sotomayor says that she is being asked to shape her speech by a third party.
