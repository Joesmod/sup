Create a concise summary of the following:


talked a lot about, you know, with all the departments coming in all, you know, the all hands on deck approach and you know all the pieces that all the departments have around violence prevention.  But there's no specific office if that's what you're asking.  And I think that again, kind of echoes our, or speaks to our priorities just like we don't have a Department of Environment, we need a Department of gun violence prevention if that's, you know, one of our biggest priorities and I would say, you know, giving all the mass shootings and everything that that would be one.  So, how much money is distributed and kind of where is it.  And if you can get that through the chair for gun violence prevention.  Do you have that number, not with me, but we could definitely provide that.  How many people in different offices are working on this effort around.  Well so around violence prevention, you know, I can say as a department in the city that it's it's everyone's, everyone is working on that.  And so when you, why, why don't we have an office where somebody is leading that effort and responsibility, or department.  What I will say is you know around violence prevention you know we work with CDP H, a lot of the funding sits under the public health department we have now the CSCC who is helping to coordinate all the different pieces as well across the departments, whether it's infrastructure, whether it's services.  So there is a coordinating body that all of us are working with.  I would appreciate if you get that I did ask during budget to us and I'll make sure we're that I don't see that through the chair.  I don't see that but I've been asking for that.  Okay, I'll just, I'll make sure that like to see that.  And how much was allocated for gun violence prevention.  Last year for violence prevention, I believe, last year, or this coming in 2022 are you asking for 2021 this year 2022 I'm sorry.  I would have to probably get that through the chair I do think it's over 100
