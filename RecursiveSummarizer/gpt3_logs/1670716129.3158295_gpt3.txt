PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


environmental office because climate change is not going away we've committed to it.  We put it in our in our in our mission statement.  And that's what you're telling us with this and maybe it should be called, not the Office of Climate and Environmental Equity but it should be called Office of the environment, which probably goes to the heart of what people are asking what what has happened with that commitment, even if you don't find it fully.  Even if you don't find 20 positions, because if you start with 20 positions, what exactly are they're going to do those people right.  But if you start with this, at least we understand what the chief sustainability officer is going to do.  And there's a deputy commissioner so you already got to heavy positions in there, and only three workers grants research specialist project manager project manager so almost 5050 you got management versus the workers.  So I don't understand that dynamic but police explain it to me.  So there's a total of 10.  So there are total of six project managers so I think you know this is kind of some of the feedback that we've heard so we do have the chief sustainable officer in a deputy position, we have someone I know that there's grant funding and lots of grant funding coming around this work so we did put a specific grants title and then there's six project managers as well as an administrative assistant to who can help with some of the day to day.  Got it.  Okay, so, and I do take point and one of my colleagues talking about that she, she's unhappy about the interagency coordination between this agency or this department.  And all the medical offices, and I would like that address because I as the first I hear of it, that this is, this is a problem.  Because if we're funding 10 positions.  Each all of me should get some type of briefing in terms of what's happening with sustainability.  Absolutely and I think that's you know, that's what we've heard.  And this is the reason why it is pulled


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Office of Climate and Environmental Equity is responsible for climate change initiatives. It is staffed with a chief sustainability officer, a deputy commissioner, grant specialists, and project managers. There is some concern that there is not enough interagency coordination between this office and other medical offices.
