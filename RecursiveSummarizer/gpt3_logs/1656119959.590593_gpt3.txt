And five Justices acceded to that cynical maneuver. They let Texas defy this Court’s constitutional rulings, nullifying Roe and Casey ahead of schedule in the Nation’s second largest State. And now the other shoe drops, courtesy of that same fiveperson majority. (We believe that THE CHIEF JUSTICE’s opinion is wrong too, but no one should think that there is not a large difference between upholding a 15-week ban on the grounds he does and allowing States to prohibit abortion from the time of conception.) Now a new and bare majority of this Court—acting at practically the first moment possible—overrules Roe and Casey. It converts a series of dissenting opinions expressing antipathy toward Roe and Casey into a decision greenlighting even total abortion bans. See ante, at 57, 59, 63, and nn. 61–64 (relying on former dissents). It eliminates a 50-year-old constitutional right that safeguards women’s freedom and equal station. It breaches a core rule-of-law principle, designed to promote constancy in the law. In doing all of that, it places in jeopardy other rights, from contraception to same-sex intimacy and marriage. And finally, it undermines the Court’s legitimacy. Casey itself made the last point in explaining why it would not overrule Roe—though some members of its majority might not have joined Roe in the first instance. Just as we did here, Casey explained the importance of stare decisis; the inappositeness of West Coast Hotel and Brown; the absence of any “changed circumstances” (or other reason) justifying the reversal of precedent. 505 U. S., at 864; see supra, at 30–33, 37–47. “[T]he Court,” Casey explained, “could not pretend” that overruling Roe had any “justification beyond a present doctrinal disposition to come out differently from the Court of 1973.” 505 U. S., at 864. And to overrule for that reason? Quoting Justice Stewart, Casey   60 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting explained that to do so—to reverse prior law “upon a ground no firmer than a change in [the Court’s] membership”— would invite the view that “this

RESPONSE:

The Guttmacher Institute has released two reports on state policy trends in reproductive health and rights. In the first report, released in 2019, the authors note a wave of abortion bans being passed in states across the country. However, they also note that some states are fighting back against these bans, with several passing laws to protect or expand access to abortion. In the second report, released in 2020, the authors note that while the overall trend continues to be towards more restrictions on abortion, there has been some progress made in some states in terms of expanding access to reproductive health care. In 2019, the Mississippi legislature passed a law banning abortion after six weeks of pregnancy. This law was challenged in court, and in October 2019 the case was heard by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The court ultimately ruled in favor of the state, upholding the law. In 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court heard a case challenging a Louisiana law that required abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. The Court ruled in a 5-4 decision that the law was unconstitutional, with the majority opinion noting that the law would likely result in the closure of most abortion clinics in the state. However, in another 5-4 decision released today, the Court has overturned its previous decision in the Whole Woman's Health case and ruled that a Mississippi law banning abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy is constitutional. This decision effectively overturns Roe v. Wade and gives states the ability to ban abortion outright. The dissent in this case notes that the majority opinion is based on a "cynical maneuver" to overturn Roe v. Wade, and that this decision will have far-reaching consequences for reproductive health and rights in the United States.
