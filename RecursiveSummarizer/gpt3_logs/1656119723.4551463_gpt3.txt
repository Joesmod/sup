Write a detailed summary of the following:

Obergefell explained, “rights were defined by who exercised them in the past, then received practices could serve as their own continued justification”—even when they conflict with “liberty” and “equality” as later and more broadly understood. 576 U. S., at 671. The Constitution does not freeze for all time the original view of what those rights guarantee, or how they apply. That does not mean anything goes. The majority wishes people to think there are but two alternatives: (1) accept the original applications of the Fourteenth Amendment and no others, or (2) surrender to judges’ “own ardent views,” ungrounded in law, about the “liberty that Americans should enjoy.” Ante, at 14. At least, that idea is what the majority sometimes tries to convey. At other times, the majority (or, rather, most of it) tries to assure the public that it has no designs on rights (for example, to contraception) that arose only in the back half of the 20th century—in other words, —————— 4The majority ignores that rejection. See ante, at 5, 13, 36. But it is unequivocal: The Glucksberg test, Obergefell said, “may have been appropriate” in considering physician-assisted suicide, but “is inconsistent with the approach this Court has used in discussing other fundamental rights, including marriage and intimacy.” 576 U. S., at 671.    18 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN’S HEALTH ORGANIZATION BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting that it is happy to pick and choose, in accord with individual preferences. See ante, at 32, 66, 71–72; ante, at 10 (KAVANAUGH, J., concurring); but see ante, at 3 (THOMAS, J., concurring). But that is a matter we discuss later. See infra, at 24–29. For now, our point is different: It is that applications of liberty and equality can evolve while remaining grounded in constitutional principles, constitutional history, and constitutional precedents. The second Justice Harlan discussed how to strike the right balance when he explained why he would have invalidated a State’s ban on contraceptive use. Judges, he said, are not “free to roam where unguided speculation might take them.” Poe v. Ullman, 367 U. S. 497, 542 (1961) (dissenting opinion). Yet they also must recognize that the constitutional “tradition” of this country is not captured whole at a single moment. Ibid. Rather, its meaning gains content from the long sweep of our history and from successive judicial precedents—each looking to the last and each seeking to apply the Constitution’s most fundamental commitments to new conditions. That is why Americans, to go back to Obergefell’s example, have a right to marry across racial lines. And it is why, to go back to Justice Harlan’s case, Americans have a right to use contraceptives so they can choose for themselves whether to have children. All that is what Casey understood. Casey explicitly rejected the present majority’s method. “[T]he specific practices of States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment,” Casey stated, do not

DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

In Obergefell v. Hodges, the Supreme Court considered whether the Fourteenth Amendment requires states to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and to recognize same-sex marriages that were lawfully licensed and performed out-of-state. The Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment does indeed require states to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and to recognize same-sex marriages that were lawfully licensed and performed out-of-state. In reaching this conclusion, the Court first explained that the right to marry is a fundamental right that is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court then explained that the Fourteenth Amendment does not freeze the original understanding of what rights are guaranteed or how they apply; instead, the Amendment allows for the evolution of these rights over time. The Court next turned to the question of whether same-sex couples should be allowed to marry. The Court explained that the right to marry is not just a fundamental right, but a right that has been recognized as fundamental throughout our history. The Court also explained that the right to marry is a fundamental right that is essential to the order and stability of society. Finally, the Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment requires states to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and to recognize same-sex marriages that were lawfully licensed and performed out-of-state. In so holding, the Court explained that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees equality for all, regardless of sexual orientation.
