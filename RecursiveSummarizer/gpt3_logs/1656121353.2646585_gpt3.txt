scheme, each trimester of pregnancy was regulated differently, but the most critical line was drawn at roughly the end of the second trimester, which, at the time, corresponded to the point at which a fetus was thought to achieve viability, i.e., the ability to survive outside the womb. Although the Court acknowledged that States had a legitimate interest in protecting potential life,1 it found that this interest could not justify any restriction on previability abortions. The Court did not explain the basis for this line, and even abortion supporters have found it hard to defend Roes reasoning. One prominent constitutional scholar wrote that he would vote for a statute very much like the one the Court end[ed] up drafting if he were a legislator, but his assessment of Roe was memorable and brutal: Roe was not constitutional law at all and gave almost no sense of an obligation to try to be.2 At the time of Roe, 30 States still prohibited abortion at all stages. In the years prior to that decision, about a third of the States had liberalized their laws, but Roe abruptly ended that political process. It imposed the same highly restrictive regime on the entire Nation, and it effectively struck down the abortion laws of every single State.3 As  1 Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113, 163 (1973). 2 J.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Roe v. Wade decision sparked a national controversy that has embittered our political culture for a half century. In the years since Roe, the issue of abortion has continued to be a highly divisive issue in the United States. In the 1992 case of Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, the Supreme Court revisited Roe, but the Court was split three ways on the issue. The three justices who signed the controlling opinion in Casey concluded that stare decisis, which calls for prior decisions to be followed in most instances, required adherence to what it called Roes central holdingthat a State may not constitutionally protect fetal life before viabilityeven if that holding was wrong.
