and no thought that the Fourteenth Amendment provided one. Of course, the majority opinion refers as well to some later and earlier history. On the one side of 1868, it goes back as far as the 13th (the 13th!) century. See ante, at 17. But that turns out to be wheel-spinning. First, it is not clear what relevance such early history should have, even to the majority. See New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v. Bruen, 597 U. S. ___, ___ (2022) (slip op., at 26) (Historical evidence that long predates [ratification] may not illuminate the scope of the right). If the early history obviously supported abortion rights, the majority would no doubt say that only the views of the Fourteenth Amendments ratifiers are germane. See ibid. (It is better not to go too far back into antiquity, except if olden law survived to become our Founders law). Secondand embarrassingly for the majorityearly law in fact does provide some support for abortion rights. Common-law authorities did not treat abortion as a crime before quickeningthe point when the fetus moved in the womb.2 And early American law followed the common-law rule.3 So the criminal law of that early time might be taken as roughly consonant with  2See, e.g., 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 129130 (7th ed. 1775) (Blackstone); E. Coke, Institutes of the Laws of England 50 (1644). 3See J. Mohr, Abortion in America: The Origins and Evolution of National Policy, 18001900, pp. 34 (1978). The majority offers no evidence to the contraryno example of a founding-era law making prequickening abortion a crime (except when a woman died). See ante, at 2021. And even in the mid-19th century, more than 10 States continued to allow pre-quickening abortions. See Brief for American Historical Association et al. as Amici Curiae 27, and n. 14.   14 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting Roes and Caseys different treatment of early and late abortions. Better, then, to move forward in time. On the other side of 1868, the majority occasionally notes that many States barred abortion up to the time of Roe. See ante, at 24, 36. That is convenient for the majority, but it is window dressing. As the same majority (plus one) just informed us, post-ratification adoption or acceptance of laws that are inconsistent with the original meaning of the constitutional text obviously cannot overcome or alter that text. New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc., 597 U. S., at ______ (slip op., at 2728). Had the pre-Roe liberalization of abortion laws occurred more quickly and more widely in the 20th century, the majority would say (once again) that only the ratifiers views are germane. The majoritys core legal postulate, then, is that we in the 21st century must read the Fourteenth Amendment just as its ratifiers did. And that is indeed what the majority emphasizes over and over again. See ante, at 47 ([T]he most important historical

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court has ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment does not provide a right to abortion. The majority opinion refers to some later and earlier history, but finds that this does not support abortion rights. Early law actually provides some support for abortion rights, but the majority offers no evidence to the contrary. The majority's core legal postulate is that we in the 21st century must read the Fourteenth Amendment just as its ratifiers did.
