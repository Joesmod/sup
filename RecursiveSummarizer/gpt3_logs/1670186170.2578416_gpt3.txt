PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


to the tune of $8.9 million per year technology that has not been independently verified.  Studies from our own inspector general, from the MacArthur Justice Center at Northwestern University, Johns Hopkins University, all of these experts have looked at ShotSpotter technology and cast serious doubts on this technology.  As a result of that, cities have canceled contracts, police departments have refused to renew contracts, because it's not technology that's working, it's not keeping us safe.  And in the instance, in many instances, it's actually harming Chicago and so I'm disappointed that ShotSpotter continues to be in this contract.  And on the issue of reopening the shutter mental health clinics, that was something that was also promised to the people of the city of Chicago and so this is the last budget of this term, where we have an opportunity to accomplish that.  And it's just deeply disappointing that despite the fact that mental health experts, clinicians, entire coalition of Chicagoans organizing around the treatment not trauma proposal have been fighting to reopen those shuttered mental health clinics, using them as an anchor for a non police mental health first responder program.  This budget fails in that regard.  So, I've got to say this budget appropriation for me, and for my community and the people that I represent has a lot to be desired.  Thank you.  Thank you, Alderman Ramirez Rosa Alderman Rodriguez.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I'd like to add on to the course regarding the Department of Environment, I think we should have gotten it done this time around, and I'm really upset that we did it.  With that said, I have read through to 31 050 section for, and I do have some questions about this proposed study.  Just to add clarity.  What is this study exactly exactly looking at is looking at feasibility, you know I brought questions to start.  What exactly will this study look, look at.  I think what we do when we get to number 10, which is in the

RESPONSE:

The city of Chicago is spending $8.9 million per year on ShotSpotter technology, which has not been independently verified. Studies from the city's inspector general, the MacArthur Justice Center at Northwestern University, and Johns Hopkins University have all cast serious doubts on the effectiveness of ShotSpotter. As a result, many cities have canceled their contracts with ShotSpotter, and police departments have refused to renew their contracts. The technology is not working and is actually harming Chicago. Alderman Ramirez Rosa is disappointed that the city is still using ShotSpotter and that mental health clinics have not been reopened as promised. He says the budget fails in this regard.
