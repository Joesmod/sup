not. The dissent also argues that an egregiously wrong decision should almost never be overruled unless its mistake is later highlighted by major legal or factual changes, but the majority does not agree.  The Court reconsidered the Roe and Casey decisions, which established a woman's right to an abortion. The Court found that the national controversy surrounding abortion has not ended, and that another decision upholding Roe would not achieve what Casey could not. The concurrence would leave for another day whether to reject any right to an abortion, but would instead focus on whether to uphold specific abortion regulations.  The Court holds that the Mississippi law is unconstitutional. The law would ban abortion after 15 weeks, with no exceptions for rape, incest, or health of the mother. The Court finds that this law violates the right to privacy established in Roe v. Wade and reaffirmed in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. The Court also finds that the law is unconstitutional because it places an undue burden on a woman's right to choose.  The Court has consistently held that the right to an abortion before viability is a central principle of Roe v.

The Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution does not protect a woman's right to an abortion after the point at which all reasonable women will have decided whether to seek one. This new rule, proposed by the concurrence, is not justified by stare decisis and would be fraught with turmoil if adopted.  The Supreme Court has ruled that rational-basis review is the appropriate standard for challenges to state abortion regulations. This means that the state has a legitimate interest in regulating abortion, and when such regulations are challenged under the Constitution, courts cannot substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies. The Court has also ruled that the law before it satisfies the appropriate standard. This law prohibits abortion if the probable gestational age of the unborn human being has been determined to be greater than fifteen weeks.  The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that abortion presents a profound moral question, and that the Constitution does not prohibit the citizens of each State from regulating or prohibiting abortion. The Court also ruled that the Roe and Casey decisions, which had arrogated that authority to the Court, are hereby overruled.  This section of the code makes it a crime for anyone to wilfully administer any medicine, drug, substance or thing to a pregnant woman, or use any instrument or other means, with the intent to procure a miscarriage, unless it is necessary to preserve the life of the woman or has been advised by two physicians to be necessary.  This section provides a summary of state laws in the United States regarding abortion. These laws typically make it a crime to
