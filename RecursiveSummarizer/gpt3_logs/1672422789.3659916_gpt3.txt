RESPONSE:

The budget for this season includes an amendment for right now, but it is more just a point that the administration has had a lot of time to work on this and then it is dumped on us at the last minute and we're here to vote. Alderman Tony is questioning the salaries for the city clerk and city treasurer, but the only change is coming in for 2023. The salary rate for the mayor is the same as it is currently.
