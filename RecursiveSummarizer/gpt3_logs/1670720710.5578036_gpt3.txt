PROMPT:

Write out the proposed spending as a dollar amount and what the spending is for of the following:


for this category.  This is a cleanup to make sure that the lobbyists understand that yes that they too are supposed to be cooperating.  Again by what authority? I mean because they're independent contractors are they they they are not a city employee correct? Correct.  Okay so under what authority does the city have to command them to cooperate? Since they already have to to register with the city and we have licenses with them that gives us the you have a license with them for for for for for lobbying.  Okay so they register like all lobbyists do and to let them know that they are conducting business that they are lobbying.  Yes.  Right.  So how can you compel them without subpoena or something to to do this? Are you are you saying that as by registering as a lobbyist with the city you agree to cooperate with the inspector general? I don't have the the the the the license before me I'd have I'd have to look at that.  Okay.  Moving on to the next page of Superintendent Chief Administrator Police Board.  Mid sentence within 30 days thereafter the mayor shall and you strike out either select one of these candidates add select a candidate comma or reject the candidates add or reappointment candidate.  What does that mean? Or is that a mistake? I'm sorry we're in section seven yes.  Yes shouldn't be yes.  So we've stricken as those commissioners as those for commissioners that set out listed and then then added listed.  Starting from within 30 days thereafter.  Ah yes so the question being is there a typo? Read the sentence.  Within 30 days thereafter the mayor shall select a candidate or reject the candidates or reappointment candidate and provide the commission with a written explanation.  So what is a reappointment candidate? If if if there's already somebody on the board and that person is going to be reappointed that's a reappointment candidate.  But that person is is you know isn't necessarily going to be reappointed.  So that person would have to be a candidate.
