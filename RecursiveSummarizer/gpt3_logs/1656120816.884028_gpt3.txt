The Court found, for example, (1) a change in legal doctrine that undermined or made obsolete the earlier decision; (2) a factual change that had the same effect; or (3) an absence of reliance because the earlier decision was less than a decade old. None of those factors apply here: Nothingand in particular, no significant legal or factual changesupports overturning a half-century of settled law giving women control over their reproductive lives. First, for all the reasons we have given, Roe and Casey were correct. In holding that a State could not resolve the debate about abortion in such a definitive way that a woman lacks all choice in the matter, the Court protected womens liberty and womens equality in a way comporting with our Fourteenth Amendment precedents. Casey, 505 U. S., at 850. Contrary to the majoritys view, the legal status of abortion in the 19th century does not weaken those decisions. And the majoritys repeated refrain about usurp[ing] state legislatures power to address a publicly contested question does not help it on the key issue here. To repeat: The point of a right is to shield individual actions and decisions from the vicissitudes of political controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts. Barnette, 319 U. S., at 638. However divisive, a right is not at the peoples mercy.

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court has ruled that the previous rulings in Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood should stand. The Court noted that there had been no changes in law or fact that had eroded the two decisions, and that tens of millions of American women had relied on the right to choose an abortion. The majority also ruled that the standards set out in Roe and Casey were perfectly workable, and that there was no justification for overruling them. However, in the dissent, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan argued that the majority was wrong to override Roe and Casey. They argued that the majority had no special justification for doing so, and that the standards set out in Roe and Casey were perfectly workable. They also argued that the majority was effectively saying that the only reason to keep Roe and Casey was because a bare majority of the Court disagreed with them. In Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the Court considered whether the Casey undue burden standard for abortion regulation is the same as the general standards that courts use for other legal spheres. The Court held that the Casey standard is the same as the general standards, and that it is not unduly burdensome. The Court also held that the state's regulation of abortion was constitutional.
