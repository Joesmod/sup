Are they more like the restaurants and the jewelers and the tailors, or are they more like, you know, the publishing  houses and the other free speech analogues that are raised on the other side?  That's what I took away from the briefs. A lot of agreement on broad legal principles and some disagreement about how to characterize the website designers. So why are you right about how you characterize website designers or, put another way, why are they different -- and you've gotten this question -- but why are they different from, say, restaurants or caterers, for example?

In addition, this Court has already articulated how we determine whether speech is involved for an artist, and I think the Court could follow those tests here, with words, graphics, videos, and, again, symbolic speech. JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: So, for you, as -- as there's an effort to protect both the equal rights of gay and lesbian people and same-sex


CONCISE SUMMARY:

The conversation is between two people discussing a court case involving gay marriage.
