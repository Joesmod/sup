had recognized such a right. Until a few years before Roe, no federal or state court had recognized such a right. Nor had any scholarly treatise. Indeed, abortion had long been a crime in every single State. At common law, abortion was criminal in at least some stages of pregnancy and was regarded as unlawful and could have very serious consequences at all stages. American law followed the common law until a wave of statutory restrictions in the 1800s expanded criminal liability for abortions. By the time the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, three-quarters of the States had made abortion a crime at any stage of pregnancy. This consensus endured until the day Roe was decided. Roe either ignored or misstated this history, and Casey declined to reconsider Roes faulty historical analysis. Respondents argument that this history does not matter flies in the face of the standard the Court has applied in determining whether an asserted right that is nowhere mentioned in the Constitution is nevertheless protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. The Solicitor General repeats Roes claim that it is doubtful . . . abortion was ever firmly established as a common-law crime even with respect to the destruction of a quick fetus, 410 U. S., at 136, but the great common-law authoritiesBracton, Coke, Hale, and Blackstoneall wrote that a postquickening abortion was a crime. Moreover, many authorities asserted that even a pre-quickening abortion was unlawful and that, as a result, an abortionist was guilty of murder if the woman died from the attempt. The Solicitor General suggests that history supports an abortion right because of the common laws failure to criminalize abortion before quickening, but the insistence on quickening was not universal, see Mills v. Commonwealth, 13 Pa. 631, 633; State v. Slagle, 83 N. C. 630, 632, and regardless, the fact that many States in the late 18th and early 19th century did not criminalize pre-quickening abortions does not mean that anyone thought the States lacked the authority to do so. Instead of seriously pressing the argument that the abortion right itself has deep roots, supporters of Roe and Casey contend that the abortion right is an integral part of a broader entrenched right. Roe termed this a right to privacy, 410 U. S., at 154, and Casey described it as the freedom to make intimate and personal choices that are central to personal dignity and autonomy, 505 U. S., at 851. Ordered     4 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Syllabus liberty sets limits and defines the boundary between competing interests. Roe and Casey each struck a particular balance between the interests of a woman who wants an abortion and the interests of what they termed potential life. Roe, 410 U. S., at 150; Casey, 505 U. S., at 852. But the people of the various States may evaluate those interests differently.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court has previously recognized a right to privacy which includes the right to have an abortion, but this right is not mentioned in the Constitution. The history of abortion shows that it has long been considered a crime, but there has been a wave of statutory restrictions in recent years. The Court has applied a standard in determining whether an asserted right is protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Solicitor General suggests that history supports an abortion right. However, the history of abortion does not necessarily mean that everyone thought the States lacked the authority to criminalize it. Instead of seriously pressing the argument that the abortion right itself has deep roots, supporters of Roe and Casey contend that the abortion right is an integral part of a broader entrenched right.
