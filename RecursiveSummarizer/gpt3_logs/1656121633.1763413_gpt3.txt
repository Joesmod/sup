Write a concise summary of the following:

need to decide important antecedent questions, including whether the Privileges or Immunities Clause protects any rights that are not enumerated in the Constitution and, if so, how to identify those rights. See id., at 854. That said, even if the Clause does protect unenumerated rights, the Court conclusively demonstrates that abortion is not one of them under any plausible interpretive approach. See ante, at 15, n. 22. Moreover, apart from being a demonstrably incorrect reading of the Due Process Clause, the legal fiction of substantive due process is particularly dangerous. McDonald, 561 U. S., at 811 (opinion of THOMAS, J.); accord, Obergefell, 576 U. S., at 722 (THOMAS, J., dissenting). At least three dangers favor jettisoning the doctrine entirely. First, substantive due process exalts judges at the expense of the People from whom they derive their authority. Ibid. Because the Due Process Clause speaks only to process, the Court has long struggled to define what substantive rights it protects. Timbs v. Indiana, 586 U. S. ___, ___ (2019) (THOMAS, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2) (internal quotation marks omitted). In practice, the Courts approach for identifying those fundamental rights unquestionably involves policymaking rather than neutral legal analysis. Carlton, 512 U. S., at 4142 (opinion of Scalia, J.); see also McDonald, 561 U. S., at 812 (opinion of THOMAS, J.) (substantive due process is a jurisprudence devoid of a guiding principle). The Court divines new rights in line with its own, extraconstitutional value preferences and nullifies state laws that do not align with the judicially created guarantees. Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747, 794 (1986) (White, J., dissenting). Nowhere is this exaltation of judicial policymaking clearer than this Courts abortion jurisprudence. In Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), the Court divined a right to Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 5 THOMAS, J., concurring abortion because it fe[lt] that the Fourteenth Amendments concept of personal liberty included a right of privacy that is broad enough to encompass a womans decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. Id., at 153. In Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833 (1992), the Court likewise identified an abortion guarantee in the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment, but, rather than a right of privacy, it invoked an ethereal right to define ones own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life. Id., at 851. As the Courts preferred manifestation of liberty changed, so, too, did the test used to protect it, as Roes author lamented. See Casey, 505 U. S., at 930 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) ([T]he Roe framework is far more administrable, and far less manipulable, than the undue burden standard). Now, in this case, the nature of the purported

RESPONSE:

In Timbs v. Indiana, the Supreme Court held that the Eighth Amendment's excessive fines clause is incorporated against the states by the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. Justice Thomas wrote a concurring opinion, in which he argued that the Court should have gone further and held that the doctrine of substantive due process is unconstitutional. Substantive due process allows courts to strike down laws that they believe violate unenumerated rights, such as the right to abortion that the Court has recognized. This approach exalts judges at the expense of the People and allows them to strike down laws that they disagree with on policy grounds.
