RESPONSE:

The requirements for mineral and battery components for electric vehicles are that a certain percentage of the value of the critical minerals contained in the battery must be extracted or processed in the United States or in a country with which the United States has a free trade agreement, or recycled in North America. The applicable percentage increases each year from 40 percent in 2024 to 80 percent in 2026.
