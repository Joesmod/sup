Write a detailed summary of the following:

the majority picks the latter. This framing is not accurate. In its brief on the merits, Mississippi in fact argued at length that a decision simply rejecting the viability rule would result in a judgment in its favor. See Brief for Petitioners 5, 38–48. But even if the State had not argued as much, it would not matter. There is no rule that parties can confine this Court to disposing of their case on a particular ground—let alone when review was sought and granted on a different one. Our established practice is instead not to “formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.” Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party, 552 U. S. 442, 450 (2008) (quoting Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring)); see also United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 21 (1960).  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 7 ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment Following that “fundamental principle of judicial restraint,” Washington State Grange, 552 U. S., at 450, we should begin with the narrowest basis for disposition, proceeding to consider a broader one only if necessary to resolve the case at hand. See, e.g., Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond, 496 U. S. 414, 423 (1990). It is only where there is no valid narrower ground of decision that we should go on to address a broader issue, such as whether a constitutional decision should be overturned. See Federal Election Comm’n v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., 551 U. S. 449, 482 (2007) (declining to address the claim that a constitutional decision should be overruled when the appellant prevailed on its narrower constitutional argument). Here, there is a clear path to deciding this case correctly without overruling Roe all the way down to the studs: recognize that the viability line must be discarded, as the majority rightly does, and leave for another day whether to reject any right to an abortion at all. See Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S. 490, 518, 521 (1989) (plurality opinion) (rejecting Roe’s viability line as “rigid” and “indeterminate,” while also finding “no occasion to revisit the holding of Roe” that, under the Constitution, a State must provide an opportunity to choose to terminate a pregnancy). Of course, such an approach would not be available if the rationale of Roe and Casey was inextricably entangled with and dependent upon the viability standard. It is not. Our precedents in this area ground the abortion right in a woman’s “right to choose.” See Carey v. Population Services Int’l, 431 U. S. 678, 688–689 (1977) (“underlying foundation of the holdings” in Roe and Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965), was the “right of decision in matters of childbearing”); Maher v. Roe, 432 U. S. 464, 473 (1977) (Roe and other cases “recognize a constitutionally protected interest in making certain kinds of important decisions free from governmental compulsion” (internal quotation marks

DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution protects a woman's right to have an abortion, but this right is not absolute. States are allowed to regulate abortion in certain ways, such as requiring parental consent for minors or banning so-called "partial-birth" abortions. In the case of Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the Court upheld a Pennsylvania law that placed several restrictions on abortion, including a 24-hour waiting period and mandatory parental consent for minors. The Court's ruling in Casey was based on the principle of stare decisis, or the principle that precedent should be followed. The Court specifically noted that its decision in Roe v. Wade, which first established the constitutional right to abortion, was still good law. However, the Court also said that Roe was not "inviolate," and that states could place certain restrictions on abortion as long as those restrictions did not place an "undue burden" on a woman's right to choose. The Court's ruling in Casey was controversial, and it was immediately challenged. In the case of Gonzales v. Carhart, the Court considered a challenge to the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003. The Court upheld the law, ruling that it did not place an undue burden on a woman's right to choose. In the present case, the Court is considering a challenge to a Mississippi law that would ban abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with no exceptions for rape, incest, or health of the mother. The law does make an exception for cases where the pregnancy poses a "substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function." The Court has two options: it can either uphold the Mississippi law, or it can strike it down. If the Court upholds the law, it would effectively overturn Roe and Casey, and abortion would once again become a matter for the states to regulate. If the Court strikes down the law, it would reaffirm the basic principles of Roe and Casey. The majority of the Court has picked the latter option, and has struck down the Mississippi law. In doing so, the Court has reaffirmed the basic principles of Roe and Casey: that the Constitution protects a woman's right to choose, and that this right is not absolute.
