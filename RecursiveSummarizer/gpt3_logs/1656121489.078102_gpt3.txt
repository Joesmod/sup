postviability abortions. Here is the Courts entire explanation: With respect to the States important and legitimate interest in potential life, the compelling point is at viability. This is so because the fetus then presumably has the capability of meaningful life outside the womb. 410 U. S., at 163. As Professor Laurence Tribe has written, [c]learly, this mistakes a definition for a syllogism. Tribe 4 (quoting Ely 924). The definition of a viable fetus is one that is capable of surviving outside the womb, but why is this the point at which the States interest becomes compelling? If, as Roe held, a States interest in protecting prenatal life is compelling after viability, 410 U. S., at 163, why isnt that interest equally compelling before viability? Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 U. S. 490, 519 (1989) (plurality opinion) (quoting Thornburgh, 476 U. S., at 795 (White, J., dissenting)). Roe did not say, and no explanation is apparent. This arbitrary line has not found much support among philosophers and ethicists who have attempted to justify a right to abortion. Some have argued that a fetus should not Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 51 Opinion of the Court be entitled to legal protection until it acquires the characteristics that they regard as defining what it means to be a person. Among the characteristics that have been offered as essential attributes of personhood are sentience, selfawareness, the ability to reason, or some combination thereof.50 By this logic, it would be an open question whether even born individuals, including young children or those afflicted with certain developmental or medical conditions, merit protection as persons. But even if one takes the view that personhood begins when a certain attribute or combination of attributes is acquired, it is very hard to see why viability should mark the point where personhood begins. The most obvious problem with any such argument is that viability is heavily dependent on factors that have nothing to do with the characteristics of a fetus. One is the  50See, e.g., P. Singer, Rethinking Life & Death 218 (1994) (defining a person as a being with awareness of her or his own existence over time, and the capacity to have wants and plans for the future); B. Steinbock, Life Before Birth: The Moral and Legal Status of Embryos and Fetuses 913 (1992) (arguing that the possession of interests is both necessary and sufficient for moral status and that the capacity for conscious awareness is a necessary condition for the possession of interests (emphasis deleted)); M. Warren, On the Moral and Legal Status of Abortion, 57 The Monist 1, 5 (1973) (arguing that, to qualify as a person, a being must have at least one of five traits that are central to the concept of personhood: (1) consciousness (of objects and events external and/or internal to the being), and in particular the capacity to feel pain; (2) reasoning (the developed capacity to

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court has ruled that the States have a compelling interest in protecting potential life, but that this interest does not become compelling until viability. This arbitrary line has not found much support among philosophers and ethicists who have attempted to justify a right to abortion.
