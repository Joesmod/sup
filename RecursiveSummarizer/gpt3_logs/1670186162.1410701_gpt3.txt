then one other question is, is this year, are you getting a bump in salary or is this your current salary now.  No, not you.  Oh, Angela told our, I mean I can answer that.  This is a bump in salary.  Garza, I want the budget director to answer this question because there is some.  It is the wants its nuance the rate here that you see in this office is the same as the current rate that you see in the mayor's office budget.  Okay, so it is equal.  I still think I know that, um, you know this administration talked about re implementing a department environment, and I think that I really wish we would do that.  I don't want this to be another like smoking mirrors office that just has meetings with people and does a lot of talking and does nothing.  So, thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you alderman Garza alderman Ramirez Rosa.  Thank you so much, Chairwoman.  So, on this conversation of the department environment, I find arguments that we just don't have enough time to get it done this budget disingenuous.  I want to read something to you all breaking we released our environmental policy exclamation point.  We've got to bring back the Department of Environment to combat climate change and ensure the Chicagoans have clean air to breathe and safe water to drink, no matter their race, economic status or zip code.  This was tweeted out by Mayor Lightfoot on January 10, 2019, a little more than a month before the primary.  We've had four years to get the Department of Environment done.  This was a central piece of a policy platform that was promised to the people of the city of Chicago, people who wanted to undo the harm caused by eight years of Rahm Emanuel when he shuttered the Department of Environment 2012.  And here we are with the last budget of this term that this body will pass.  And with the death of seniors in Rogers Park as a result of not being prepared as a city to deal with climate change and record heat with people suffering losses to their property as a result


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The question is whether the budget for the upcoming year includes a salary increase. The answer is that it does not, and that the budget director thinks this is disingenuous. There is a central piece of the budget that has not been addressed, which is the re-implementation of the Department of Environment. This was promised four years ago, but has not been done.
