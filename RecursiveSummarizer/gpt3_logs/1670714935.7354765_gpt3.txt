PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


Is the question addressed to me, Alderman Dow? Yes.  Yes, thank you.  That is correct.  The effort is to look within the area where the work is located.  If it is a social disadvantaged area, then the emphasis is to hire from there.  And then should they need more than what they were able to find, then they can look at other areas that are social disadvantaged as well.  And that is specifically called out in the ordinance.  What you just said, is that specifically called down in the ordinance? LaRiato, can you respond to that? I think that the ordinance under discussion is the one which is proposed by Alderman Arvin and Alderman Sawyer.  So in that ordinance, the only change I see is that instead of hiring from the project area for construction contractors, that value 100,000 or more, the contractors to meet their percentage requirement, they can hire from socioeconomically disadvantaged areas.  So the specific point you raised, Madam Anduel is not specifically addressed in the ordinance, but I defer that to the sponsors of the ordinance if they want to make that clarification.  So Mr.  Chairman and to the Alderman Sawyer, Chairman Sawyer who sponsored this ordinance, would that be something you would consider including that the community, if you're the host of a city project and it's then a social disadvantaged or whatever that term was, economically disadvantaged community, that that community area would get first, if so to speak, on the job.  As far as a preference of hiring, I would not have an objection to that.  And again, that's why we have these hearings to look at from a preference perspective, but I would say, I would keep in mind that the object is to generate longer term opportunities for residents that live in socioeconomically disadvantaged areas to incentivize employers to keep those individuals on the job.  So just as an individual that may live in the third ward has an opportunity to work in the 28th ward and vice versa so that we're not essentially


CONCISE SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

The ordinance being discussed would require contractors to hire from socioeconomically disadvantaged areas for city projects. Alderman Sawyer, who sponsored the ordinance, says that he would not have an objection to giving preference to the community where the project is located.
