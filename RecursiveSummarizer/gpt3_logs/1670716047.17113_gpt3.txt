center, if you want to vote in the first ward and you live in the 50th, you can do so.  You can also still do so on election day for November 8th.  However, this temporary legislation is set to expire at the end of this year.  We have made contact with the O&A legislature in support of legislation of making this permanent so we can continue using early voting sites as vote centers on election day within Chicago.  This sends an important message to the state legislature on the city's support and we hope they take up this issue by year's end.  Thank you, Chair.  Thank you, Max.  And I just wanted to get this on our plate and to have all of the city council to support this resolution because it's really important that we maintain access and to the ballot for all the people that live in the state of Illinois given what we're seeing across the country in terms of voter suppression and not allowing folks to vote.  We want to make access easier, not harder.  Alderman Osterman followed by Alderman Rodriguez and then Alderman Garza.  Thank you.  Just one quick question.  Mr.  Holliday, I believe when he was before us, said that the city may be going in the future to having two locations per ward.  Is that being planned for future elections? And if you don't know, you can get back to me.  We did provide through the chair response the budget of what 100 early voting sites within the city would look like.  I'm afraid I don't have that exact number of things before me, but we would be happy to continue to discuss with city council 100 early voting sites for an election over what is provided right now, which is the 50 sites.  My colleagues that will be on the ballot will want to know that.  Let me just also just more in a very practical way, encourage the board of election.  I got my mail yesterday, which was a nice letter to my wife and I telling us where to early vote and where polling places on election day.  Many of our wards or all of our wards went through a precinct
