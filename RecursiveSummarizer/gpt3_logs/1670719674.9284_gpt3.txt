distinction right there.  MR. OLSON: Yes.  JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: You put your  finger on it, I think. So the website designer  is different from the publishing house how?  MR. OLSON: Because the website designer is refusing to -- to publish gay authors using the publishing house example. They are saying, I will not provide this service to someone because of who they are, period. JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: They say it's because of the message. MR. OLSON: I -- I -- I understand, but they define the service in a way that excludes people based on who they are, and that violates Colorado law. And to the extent there's some incidental impact on their message, it's the kind of incidental impact that this Court held in O'Brien as to be appropriate, where a law is focused on conduct and not the -- the message itself. JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: I felt the amicus brief of Professors Carpenter and Volokh was fairly interesting.

They say a website designer is unlike a baker and that Hurley therefore is the key precedent here, and they say there is no serious  question, their words, no serious question that  this case involves compelled speech. Do you agree it involves compelled speech? MR. OLSON: No. JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: Even though they say there's no serious question that it does, you disagree with that? MR. OLSON: We disagree with that. JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: Okay. Thank you. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Justice Barrett? JUSTICE BARRETT: How can you disagree with that in light of the stipulations that Justice Gorsuch reviewed with you? Because, if it's speech, you know, as the stipulations Justice Gorsuch read did, and she has to say it, why isn't it compelled speech?
