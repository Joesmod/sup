as well.  So Max and my colleagues to please support this endeavor that on the bill and I have fought for by no mean for 12 years and more.  Thank you, Madam President, you all the women Austin the chair recognizes Ottoman bill.  Thank you, Madam President.  I too rise to ask my colleagues to support this red line tip.  I think it's very important that everyone, everyone knows that this was a promise to our community over 40 something years ago.  Almost 50.  And I remember as a kid growing up, talking about the red line extension that was the buzz throughout the entire community that people were saying, where we, when are we going to get ours.  When are we going to get the promise that is being fulfilled to our community.  And like all the men Austin stated, we fought to get this going, years ago, under Mayor daily.  And then Mayor Emmanuel kept the ball rolling.  And I'm glad that Mayor, you saw fit to create this tip to continue the momentum of this red line extension.  Our community has been this invested disenfranchised and disconnected from this city for a very long time for a very long time.  And so now, to be in phase five or phase seven of the federal process to get to construction, the next phase is engineering and design.  And then the last phase is construction.  And so it's very important that you all understand that our community has been disconnected.  And we're looking forward to getting this connection, some 50 years later.  And I'm just hoping that I'm around long enough to see it.  And, you know, it's just, it's really really disheartening that we are even talking about this today.  And they're talking about the fact that certain communities don't get the same access from CTA as other communities.  And so this is another opportunity for everybody to right the wrong.  The turn the ship around and put it in the right direction to make sure our community gets their fair share.  And so I employ everybody to look deep into your heart and understand that

RESPONSE:

I am asking my colleagues to support the red line extension tip. This was a promise to our community over 40 years ago and we have fought for it for years. The next phase is engineering and design, and then the last phase is construction. Our community has been disconnected and this is an opportunity to right the wrong.
