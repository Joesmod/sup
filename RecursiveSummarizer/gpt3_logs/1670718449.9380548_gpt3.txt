in in the world for with this effort questions members of the committee just a comment by me too uh...  brian and to dvd i think you know this initiative a lot of us support uh...  in a very significant way census initiative started we've had uh...  increased housing costs increase interest rates uh...  inflation that makes it more difficult for people to buy homes uh...  my point is that time is of the essence and i think that having a very strong coordinated effort with dvd in housing to make sure that were expediting uh...  the development of these homes i think uh...  is very needed uh...  for uh...  the community so i think uh...  you could take that back to the commissioners and and make sure that we work with uh...  haste uh...  i would appreciate that i know that uh...  others would as well all the most part of thank you so much and this might end up being a deputy commissioner essenberg question in about ten fifteen minutes but i'm just curious cuz chairman ulcerman put it really succinctly that the affordability of housing is being squeezed on both sides both on the construction costs in the way rising interest rates are probably increasing mortgage costs by particularly in the community that you're trying to serve how do we how do we adjust for those impacts in the work of creating new homeownership opportunities alderman brano donnell this this endeavor here is is one such attempt where we help the land the building of the house cost is greatly lower because the city is is absorbing some of that cost and uh...  the reclaiming chicago effort which is that a kind of umbrella name is is going to be uh...  all over the south and west side so it's not uh...  not just a one-off yet i would just say just to to build on brine said uh...  by by using city resources on city-owned land so these are all city owned lots uh...  we're able to strip out about a hundred thousand dollars of the site costs uh...  which makes a three hundred fifty thousand dollar uh...  new


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The city is wasting money on an initiative to increase housing costs and interest rates, which will make it more difficult for people to buy homes. This is not a one-time event, and city resources could be better used elsewhere.
