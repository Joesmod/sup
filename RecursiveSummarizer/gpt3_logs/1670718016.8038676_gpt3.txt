Write an explanation as to how the following will benefit the City:


three year program supported by $8 million in funding from the emergency rental assistance program is expected to play a pivotal role in preventing and minimizing the disruption of hardship caused by the eviction process.  Additional policy initiatives, on April 12th DOH joined with the university of Chicago's foundation to fund family school social work policy and practice and announcing a new partnership to examine how city governments around the world are using housing policies to promote wealth creation in communities of color.  Over the coming months a research team will survey the myriad ways in which cities around the world are developing strategies for housing policy.  This team will produce a final report and the university's man sweat institute for urban innovation will convene in global symposium that will bring together housing leaders from select cities to look at such as housing and housing opportunities and support outcomes here in Chicago.  This partnership reaffirms the cities and DOH's continuing commitment to evaluate outcomes of its work through a racial equity lens.  And under some of the program activities or policies we also introduced legislation through city council in April to help preserve low cost affordable housing options for at risk SROs.  Under a partnership with the city of Chicago, the new SRO preservation fund earmarks $5 million from AHOP funds and additional CRP resources to assist existing prospective SRO owners refinance construction or rehab loans.  The SRO fund also secures long term affordability for these properties with owners required to main rent levels at 50% AMI or below.  To qualify for city assistance developers must first secure private construction financing which is also available through the city council's application.  And lastly as we heard a little bit today, ironically in 2021 we reported the city council's approval of a major northwest side rental project that would double its share of affordable rental
