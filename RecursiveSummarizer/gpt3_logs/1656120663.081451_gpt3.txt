clear than in the Court's abortion jurisprudence, which has been marked by a lack of a clear guiding principle. In this case, the Court must decide whether the state of Louisiana has placed an "undue burden" on women seeking abortions, in violation of their right to privacy.  The liberty supporting the abortion right has shifted yet again. Respondents and the United States propose three interests that supposedly spring from the Due Process Clause: bodily integrity, personal autonomy in matters of family, medical care, and faith, and women's equal citizenship. However, the fact that 50 years have passed since Roe and abortion advocates still cannot coherently articulate the right (or rights) at stake proves that the abortion is a policy goal in desperate search of a constitutional justification. Second, substantive due process distorts other areas of constitutional law. For example, once this Court identifies a "fundamental" right for one class of individuals, it invokes the Equal Protection Clause to demand exacting scrutiny of statutes that deny the right to others. Statutory classifications implicating certain "nonfundamental" rights, meanwhile, receive only cursory review. Similarly, this Court deems unconstitutionally "vague" or "overbroad" those laws that impinge on its preferred rights, while letting slide those laws that implicate supposedly lesser values. Third, substantive due process is often wielded to "disastrous ends." For instance, in Dred Scott v. Sandford, the Court invoked a species of substantive due process to announce that Congress was powerless to emancipate slaves brought into the federal territories. While Dred Scott was overruled by the Civil War and by constitutional amendment, that overruling was not the end of the Court's use of substantive due process to achieve policy goals. The Court has continued to use substantive due process to strike down laws regulating abortion, contraception, and other areas of personal autonomy. This use of substantive due process has led to "disastrous ends" and has distorted other areas of constitutional law.  In the case of Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pea, the Supreme Court ruled that the use of racial preferences in government contracting was unconstitutional. In his concurring opinion, Justice Thomas argued that the Constitution does not protect a right to abortion, and that the Court's decisions in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey have caused immeasurable harm to the country. He called for the elimination of the doctrine of substantive due process, which he believes conflicts with the text of the Constitution. Today, the Supreme Court overruled Roe and Casey, two of the most controversial and divisive decisions in the Court's history. In doing so, the Court recognized the harm that has been caused by the Court's previous decisions on abortion, and affirmed the right of the States to protect fetal life. This decision will have far-reaching implications for the future of
