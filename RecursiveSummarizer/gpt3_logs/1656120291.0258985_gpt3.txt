charged with murder if the woman died as a result of the abortion.  In the early 1800s, both England and America held that abortion was a crime, punishable by death. This was based on the common law, which held that abortion of a quick child was a heinous misdemeanor. In America, manuals for justices of the peace typically restated the common-law rule on abortion. Cases from the early colonial period corroborate that abortion was a crime. By the 19th century, courts frequently explained that the common law made abortion of a quick child a crime.  The original ground for drawing a distinction between pre- and post-quickening abortions is not entirely clear, but some have attributed the rule to the difficulty of proving that a pre-quickening fetus was alive. At that time, there were no scientific methods for detecting pregnancy in its early stages, and thus, as one court put it in 1872, the law had to rely on the mother's subjective experience of quickening (the first physical proof of life) as the best evidence of fetal life. However, this rule was abandoned in the 19th century, as commentators criticized it as being out of step with medical knowledge and the principles of the common law. During this period, courts began to treat a fetus as a person for many purposes, regardless of whether or not it had quickened.  The British Parliament made abortion a crime in 1803 at all stages of pregnancy with severe punishment. This was due in part to medical concern that fetal life should be protected by law at all stages of gestation. In the US during the 19th century, the vast majority of states enacted statutes criminalizing abortion at all stages of pregnancy. By 1868, when the 14th amendment was ratified, 28 out of 37 states had enacted statutes making abortion a crime even if it was performed before quickening. Rhode Island criminalized abortion at all stages in 1861.  The Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade is often cited as proof that abortion is a "deeply rooted" right in the United States. However, a close examination of the history of abortion in the US reveals that this is far from the case. Prior to Roe, abortion was illegal in almost every state in the US. And even after Roe, a majority of states still had laws on the books prohibiting abortion except in cases where the mother's life was at risk. In other words, the right to abortion is not deeply rooted in US history or tradition.  In Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court found that a woman's right to obtain an abortion is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. However, this right was not established when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted. Instead, it was only established in the latter part of the 20th century. Prior to Roe, there was an unbroken tradition of prohibiting abortion on pain of criminal punishment. This tradition persisted from the earliest days of the common law until 1973.

In the early 1800s, both England and America held that abortion was a crime, punishable by death.

Prior to Roe, there was an unbroken tradition of prohibiting abortion on pain of criminal punishment. This tradition persisted from the earliest days of the common law until 1973. The vast majority of states criminalized abortion at all stages of pregnancy by the time Roe was decided, and the Court's decision in Roe therefore represented a break from this tradition.
