Blackstone called it the “established rule to abide by former precedents.” 1 Blackstone 69. Stare decisis “promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles.” Payne, 501 U. S., at 827.

DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The U.S. Supreme Court has overturned the Roe v. Wade decision, which has protected a woman's right to abortion for the past 50 years. In a close 5-4 decision, the Court ruled that states can now ban abortion entirely, or place restrictions on it that make it effectively impossible to obtain. This decision will have a profound impact on the lives of women across the country, as well as on the reproductive rights movement more broadly. The majority opinion, written by Chief Justice John Roberts, argued that the Roe decision was wrongly decided and that the Constitution does not protect a woman's right to abortion. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, wrote a concurring opinion that argued that the Roe decision was "an erroneous decision" and that the Court should not have been hesitant to overturn it. The dissenting opinion, written by Justice Stephen Breyer and joined by Justice Elena Kagan, argued that the Roe decision was correctly decided and that the Court should not have overturned it. The dissenters argued that the majority opinion will have a harmful impact on women's lives and that it flies in the face of the Court's precedent on reproductive rights.
