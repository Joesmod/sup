active in making people nervous about things I say sometimes but it's to generate the conversation.  And one of the things I have a question about is the application process.  Now currently, with the MBWB, there's a an application process.  And there's variety materials that have to be submitted.  And question.  First question, is there a fee, I can't remember it's been so long since I've been involved.  I think so but that perhaps Miss him and his can help us out here.  Yes, ultimately there is a fee and it's $250.  Yes, and that's where my number one concern is, is that we're going to be not that that we're paying it is that nobody else is.  I mean if we're going to truly be consistent.  I'm asking black and brown contractors to probably have a separate division in their firms for compliance to constantly have documents, pay the fee, do all these things, yet our white counterparts just be they do nothing.  And we need to be consistent for everyone to pay a fee to be registered as a potential vendor for the city of Chicago.  Well, I suppose, um, I can tell you that out of the 175 people I talked to literally not a single person raised the fee as a barrier.  It's a thing that was brought to me about a couple of months ago.  Okay.  And it was brought because they said that it was unfair.  Why do we pay a fee, why do we have to have sections of our firm dedicated towards compliance to prove that I'm black or to prove that I'm brown, but yet others can come in and just bid on contracts, and they're freeing up funds, sometimes, you know, 10s of thousands of dollars worth of time and effort.  You know, I've done these certifications in the past.  It's a process.  It's a thing.  And these individuals are spending their time and effort to prove that they're black or prove they're Hispanic or to prove their Asian or prove that they're women, but yet there's nothing where white contractors have to do anything, and they feel that they've already started.  As we're talking


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The individual is concerned that the application process for the MBWB is unfair, as it requires black and brown contractors to jump through extra hoops (e.g. paying a fee, having sections of their firm dedicated to compliance) that white contractors do not.
