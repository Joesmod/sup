employment conditions. The Court reasoned that the intervening decision in Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins had made clear the fallacy underlying the Darby decision. Finally, the Court partially overruled Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, holding that the First Amendment does not protect campaign-related speech to the same extent as other speech.  In its decision in Janus v. AFSCME, the Supreme Court held that requiring public employees to pay fees to a union violates the First Amendment. This decision overruled the Court's previous decision in Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed. The Court based its decision on "both factual and legal" developments that had "eroded the decision's underpinnings and left it an outlier among our First Amendment cases." The Court noted that there had been a significant change in the legal landscape since Abood was decided, with a number of cases coming out against mandatory union fees. The Court also noted that there had been a change in social understanding of the role of unions, with unions no longer being seen as solely benefiting employees, but also benefiting the employers. The Court held that the First Amendment does not allow for mandatory union fees, and that the only way to ensure that public employees are not forced to pay for union activities that they do not support is to overturn Abood.  In Union Gas Co., the Supreme Court held that local governments are not constitutionally immune from federal employment laws. The decision overruled National League of Cities v. Usery, which had held that local governments are immune from federal laws regulating wages and hours. The Court in Union Gas reasoned that the Usery decision was unworkable and, in practice, undermined the federalism principles the decision sought to protect. In Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, the Court held that local governments are not constitutionally immune from federal employment laws. The decision overruled National League of Cities v. Usery, which had held that local governments are immune from federal laws regulating wages and hours. The Court in Garcia reasoned that the Usery decision was unworkable and, in practice, undermined the federalism principles the decision sought to protect. Today's decision to overrule 50- and 30-year-old watershed constitutional precedents that remain unweakened by any changes of law or fact is analogous to the decisions in Union Gas and Garcia.
