No view, Casey thought, could do more lasting injury to this Court and to the system of law which it is our abiding mission to serve. Ibid. For overruling Roe, Casey concluded, the Court would pay a terrible price. 505 U. S., at 864. The Justices who wrote those wordsOConnor, Kennedy, and Souterthey were judges of wisdom. They would not have won any contests for the kind of ideological purity some court watchers want Justices to deliver. But if there were awards for Justices who left this Court better than they found it? And who for that reason left this country better? And the rule of law stronger? Sign those Justices up. They knew that the legitimacy of the Court [is] earned over time. Id., at 868. They also would have recognized that it can be destroyed much more quickly. They worked hard to avert that outcome in Casey. The American public, they thought, should never conclude that its constitutional protections hung by a threadthat a new majority, adhering to a new doctrinal school, could by dint of numbers alone expunge their rights. Id., at 864. It is hardno, it is impossibleto conclude that anything else has happened here. One of us once said that [i]t is not often in the law that so few have so quickly changed so much. S. Breyer, Breaking the Promise of Brown: The Resegregation of Americas Schools 30 (2022). For all of us, in our time on this Court, that has never been more true than today. In overruling Roe and Casey, this Court betrays its guiding principles. With sorrowfor this Court, but more, for the many millions of American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional protectionwe dissent.

APPENDIX This Appendix analyzes in full each of the 28 cases the majority says support todays decision to overrule Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973), and Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833 (1992). As explained herein, the Court in each case relied on traditional stare decisis factors in overruling. A great many of the overrulings the majority cites involve a prior precedent that had been rendered out of step with or effectively abrogated by contemporary case law in light of intervening developments in the broader doctrine.
