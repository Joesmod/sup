PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


job really is not to advocate for a contractor, they're the procurement department.  So I think many of the recommendations that we made are really geared towards the problem that you so correctly diagnose, which is how do we help these firms to grow and compete? Also to help them go get work in the private sector, where you get paid a lot faster, there's a lot less bureaucracy and regulation, and where the profit margins are often better.  So how do we encourage that growth as well? So we think there are a lot of things to do, and let's take a temperature check, and I don't know, 12, 24 months, and see whether or not improvements have been made.  But I think there are some things that we know to do that we know work.  And so our suggestion is let's get about the business.  My last question, I know because I know there's other questions, but my last question, around some of the recommendations that are in bonding, I do think that right now, as we have federal infrastructure dollars coming in to the city, are there provisions that we can put in terms of bonding, but of course, that can be directed towards the firms and the small contractors who did it the most.  And also when it comes to federal contracts, or federal funding, are there provisions that we see other examples in other cities, because as we see the issue right now, and everybody talks about the issue of violence in the city, the biggest predictor is unemployment and poverty.  If we can get these contractors to hire locally, we can improve our economic conditions on the neighborhoods.  I do think that we will do more justice to our communities.  So in terms of like some concrete, maybe recommendations, I know maybe you can expand a little bit on the bonding and maybe what other cities are doing, but also around federal dollars, how we can make sure that we encourage, because I do think that the government can help us regulate the private market, but also lead by example, in kind of what we want to see in


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The job of the procurement department is not to advocate for a contractor, but to help them grow and compete. There are many things that can be done to improve the situation, and the department should take a temperature check in 12-24 months to see if improvements have been made. One suggestion is to put provisions in place for bonding and federal contracts that encourage hiring locally.
