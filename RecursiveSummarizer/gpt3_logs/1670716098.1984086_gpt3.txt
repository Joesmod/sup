Environment.  So, I think that the immediate answer to that is there should be a governance structure that helps advance the city to a clean energy future.  And right now and what we have seen we have done a best practice scan across many cities, most cities have both the effort on behalf of an office at a higher level that is charged with strategic coordination is critical here.  So most cities, if you look at New York.  If you look at Los Angeles if you look at Boston Philadelphia, there is both a coordinating climate office and a Department of Environment.  We don't have a Department of Environment and your idea of strategically planning.  Does that, does your opinion strategically planning include the alderman, because my experience with you, you do not include the alderman.  Okay.  Yes, yes, it does include the alderman.  We have created many processes by which alderman have been engaged.  We are very proud that we just released a decarbonization point report with for alderman serving here in this room I believe that as part of that table to identify strategies to transition the city's buildings to think about retrofits at scale, and to think about how we could advance a robust plan.  We have also included and engaged folks in the climate action plan as well.  So we have created many opportunities to engage alders in climate planning and an implementation as well.  And Chairman Garza I know we're not at item number 10 yet.  But there is within the management ordinance and the, as we create this office in this next year, we are committing to doing this commission also bring it before Council before we actually put the department's budget together in 2024, you know, we're committing to moving that direction, and there will be a conversation definitely with through the committee's external and internal engagement around you know what we want this department and how we're, you know, we want it to be a robust department.  We do have that built in into the management

==========

RESPONSE:

The city should have a centralized climate office to help coordinate efforts to transition to clean energy. This office should engage with alderman and the public to get input on climate planning and implementation.
