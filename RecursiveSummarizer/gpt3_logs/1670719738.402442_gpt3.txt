MR. FLETCHER: Correct. And can I explain why we think -- JUSTICE GORSUCH: Sure. Sure.  MR. FLETCHER: -- that's the right to  think about the case? Because we think the  first question is, is the burden that's being imposed on Ms. Smith incidental to a content-neutral regulation of conduct that says you can't turn people away because of status. JUSTICE GORSUCH: Right. MR. FLETCHER: So, to us, the first question is, is what she's doing status-based discrimination? JUSTICE GORSUCH: Right. MR. FLETCHER: And if the answer is yes, then the burden is incidental even if she thinks it affects her -- JUSTICE GORSUCH: No, I -- I -- I -- I -- I got that about an hour ago, but thank you. MR. FLETCHER: I -- I -- I -- I apologize. JUSTICE GORSUCH: Now the -- the -- Heritage Reporting Corporation                           1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Official - Subject to Final Review 142 the other question I had is, in your view, this is status-based, but Justice Barrett's hypothetical of the inverse situation is  message-based.  MR. FLETCHER: I wouldn't describe it as the inverse situation because I didn't understand the hypothetical to say that the  campus print -- website design company was turning people away because of their status. I understood it to be turning them away because they wanted to say things that the company would not say. JUSTICE GORSUCH: That's one way of describing it, or one might describe it as turning away those with traditionalist views of marriage based on their religious beliefs, conservative Christians, for example. MR. FLETCHER: So I guess I just disagree

The conversation is about whether or not a burden imposed on a person is incidental to a content-neutral regulation. The first question is whether or not the person is discriminating based on status. If the answer is yes, then the burden is incidental even if the person thinks it affects them.
