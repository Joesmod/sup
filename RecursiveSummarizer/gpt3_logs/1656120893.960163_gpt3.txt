RESPONSE:

In a 5-4 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court has issued a ruling that dramatically curtails women's access to abortion, overturning longstanding precedent in the process. In the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the Court held that a Louisiana law requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital imposes an "undue burden" on women's access to abortion, and is therefore unconstitutional. The Court's decision is a blow to abortion rights advocates, who had hoped that the Court would use the case to reaffirm its commitment to protecting women's reproductive rights. The majority opinion, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, relies heavily on the notion of stare decisis, or the principle of respecting precedent. Thomas argues that the Court's previous decisions in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which affirmed a woman's right to choose to have an abortion, should not be overturned lightly. However, he goes on to say that the Louisiana law at issue does not impose an undue burden on women's access to abortion, and therefore it is constitutional. The dissenting opinion, written by Justice Stephen Breyer, is sharply critical of the majority's reasoning.
