history, the opinion spent many paragraphs conducting the sort of fact-finding that might be undertaken by a legislative committee. This included a lengthy account of the "position of the American Medical Association" and "the position of the American Public Health Association," as well as the vote by the American Bar Association's House of Delegates in February 1972 on proposed abortion legislation. Finally, after all this, the Court turned to precedent. Citing a broad array of cases, the Court found support for a woman's right to abortion. However, the Court's reasoning was circular, as it based its decision on the fact that there was a long-standing tradition of abortion being legal - even though that tradition was only a few years old at the time of Roe.  The constitutional "right of personal privacy" protects the right to make important personal decisions without government interference. This right was first recognized in the case of Griswold v. Connecticut, which invalidated a state law prohibiting the use of contraceptives. The right was extended to unmarried persons in Eisenstadt v. Baird, and to abortion in Roe v. Wade. Roe held that states could not ban abortion outright, but could place restrictions on the procedure during the first and second trimesters of pregnancy. The Court reasoned that the state's interest in protecting the health of the mother outweighed the interests of the fetus during the first trimester, but that the state's interest in protecting the life of the fetus became increasingly compelling as the pregnancy progressed. The Court's reasoning in Roe has been criticized for its failure to justify the distinction it drew between pre- and post-viability abortions. The Court has also been criticized for its deference to the judgments of legislatures in areas where there is scientific uncertainty.  The Court begins by explaining that the "compelling" point for the State's interest in potential life is at viability. This is because the fetus then has the capability of meaningful life outside the womb. The Court goes on to say that Roe held that a State's interest in protecting prenatal life is compelling after viability, but that this arbitrary line has not found much support among philosophers and ethicists who have attempted to justify a right to abortion. Some have argued that a fetus should not be entitled to legal protection until it acquires certain attributes that they regard as defining what it means to be a "person." However, the Court points out that this would mean that even born individuals, including young children or those afflicted with certain developmental or medical conditions, might not merit protection as "persons." The Court concludes by saying that it is very hard to see why viability should mark the point where "personhood" begins.  1. The Roe v. Wade decision held that States did not have a compelling interest in protecting a fetus prior to viability. 2. The viability line has changed over the years,

==========

RESPONSE:

The Roe v. Wade decision held that states did not have a compelling interest in protecting a fetus prior to viability. The Court reasoned that the state's interest in protecting the health of the mother outweighed the interests of the fetus during the first trimester, but that the state's interest in protecting the life of the fetus became increasingly compelling as the pregnancy progressed. The Court's reasoning in Roe has been criticized for its failure to justify the distinction it drew between pre- and post-viability abortions. The Court has also been criticized for its deference to the judgments of legislatures in areas where there is scientific uncertainty.
