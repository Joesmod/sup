PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


you is that first step you know we've added additional positions from when we originally started with what we see in the management ordinance is that there will be work going on.  And, you know, we are commissioning a study to really look at where all those roles went.  So what do we pull back in, and you know hopefully in 2024 we will come back with a robust departments.  Well, then thank you for answering the question but I'd, you know, be happy to share the old budget books pre manual, getting rid of the department.  Yes, it's easy to recreate.  I've seen that I would advocate for zero based budgeting approach.  If we're going to create a new department let's start literally at zero and build it up.  First departments receive the inspectors and all that.  I don't think we need an interim step I would advocate for creating the department start small and maybe perhaps grow over time but these offices are not the same as a department, I would say that this, what you see before you is a step middle step, it is a small step.  It is a department number, just like every other you know department here in the city you know it will be in the appropriation of the ordinance when that prints at the end of all this.  It will be a separate department page we have given it, you know, the deal we number which is 72.  So, you know, what we have before you is that is that first small step I think leading to the broader department I won't belabor it.  I mean I would have liked you to have taken a much larger step and you know it's a conversation we've been having for a few years now not just in the past week and so again I do hope that we get back to a place where we have a department because it is incredibly important, based on some recent events around the city, involving pollution control.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Thank you, Alderman Riley.  So going from one to 50 instead of one to 100, sometimes gone one to 100 we may not get it right so one to 50 might be a more prudent
