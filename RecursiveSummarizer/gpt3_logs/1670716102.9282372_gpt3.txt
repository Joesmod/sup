And on the issue of reopening the shutter mental health clinics, that was something that was also promised to the people of the city of Chicago and so this is the last budget of this term, where we have an opportunity to accomplish that.

This budget fails in that regard.  So, I've got to say this budget appropriation for me, and for my community and the people that I represent has a lot to be desired.  Thank you.  Thank you, Alderman Ramirez Rosa Alderman Rodriguez.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I'd like to add on to the course regarding the Department of Environment, I think we should have gotten it done this time around, and I'm really upset that we did it.  With that said, I have read through to 31 050 section for, and I do have some questions about this proposed study.  Just to add clarity.  What

The budget fails to reopen shuttered mental health clinics, and also continues to fund ShotSpotter technology despite serious doubts about its effectiveness.
