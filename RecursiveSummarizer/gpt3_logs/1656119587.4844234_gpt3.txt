was workability. See 505 U. S., at 870. But see ante, at 53 (opinion of the Court) (discussing the difficulties in applying the viability standard). Although the plurality attempted to add more content by opining that “it might be said that a woman who fails to act before viability has consented to the State’s intervention on behalf of the developing child,” Casey, 505 U. S., at 870, that mere suggestion provides no basis for choosing viability as the critical tipping point. A similar implied consent argument could be made with respect to a law banning abortions after fifteen weeks, well beyond the point at which nearly all women are aware that they are pregnant, A.

J., concurring in judgment of Pregnancy Recognition and Prenatal Care Use: A Population-based Study in the United States 39 (2010) (Pregnancy Recognition). The dissent, which would retain the viability line, offers no justification for it either. This Court’s jurisprudence since Casey, moreover, has “eroded” the “underpinnings” of the viability line, such as they were. United States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 521 (1995). The viability line is a relic of a time when we recognized only two state interests warranting regulation of abortion: maternal health and protection of “potential life.” Roe, 410 U. S., at 162–163. That changed with Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U. S. 124 (2007). There, we recognized a broader array of interests, such as drawing “a bright line that clearly distinguishes abortion and infanticide,” maintaining societal ethics, and preserving the integrity of the medical profession. Id., at 157–160. The viability line has nothing to do with advancing such permissible goals. Cf. id., at 171 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (Gonzales “blur[red] the line, firmly drawn in Casey, between previability and postviability abortions”); see also R. Beck, Gonzales, Casey, and the Viability Rule, 103 Nw. U. L. Rev. 249, 276–279 (2009). Consider, for example, statutes passed in a number of jurisdictions that forbid abortions after twenty weeks of pregnancy, premised on the theory that a fetus can feel pain at that stage of development. See, e.g., Ala. Code §26–23B–2 (2018). Assuming that prevention of fetal pain is a legitimate state interest after Gonzales, there seems to be no reason why viability would be relevant to the permissibility of such laws. The same is true of laws designed to “protect[] the integrity and ethics of the medical profession” and restrict procedures likely to “coarsen society” to the “dignity of human life.” Gonzales, 550 U. S., at 157. Mississippi’s law, for instance, was premised in part on the legislature’s finding that the “dilation and evacuation” procedure is a “barbaric practice, dangerous for the maternal patient, and    Cite as: 597 U.

DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

In the case of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the Supreme Court was asked to consider the constitutionality of a Mississippi law that bans abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. The Court ultimately struck down the law, but in doing so, Chief Justice Roberts offered a concurring opinion that called into question the long-standing precedent of Roe v. Wade. In Roe, the Court had established that abortions were constitutionally protected up until the point of viability, when a fetus could survive outside the womb. However, Roberts argued that this line is no longer tenable in light of subsequent decisions, such as Gonzales v. Carhart, which recognized a broader array of state interests in regulating abortion. Roberts also noted that the line is increasingly difficult to apply as medical technology advances. Ultimately, Roberts concluded that while the Mississippi law is unconstitutional, the Court should reconsider the viability standard set forth in Roe. This could have major implications for abortion rights going forward, as it could open the door for more restrictive laws to be passed at the state level.
