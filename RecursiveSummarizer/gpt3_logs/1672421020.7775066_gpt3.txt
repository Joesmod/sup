PROMPT:

Extract names of goverment proposals from the following text:


climate crisis it wasn't a problem, it was a challenge, it was a crisis.  And then in January of 2021.  We requested a study looking at what a department of the environment would look like and we are just past two years there and so much of the work that has happened is laudable and I don't deny that 188 million in environmental assistance sustainability investments.  The decarbonization plan is great, the climate action plan is great.  It deserves a department.  It deserves a department that I appreciate what we are doing here but I, the things that we call offices in the city of Chicago never build out beyond that stature.  I would be fine starting with this head count, I would be fine.  I don't have the power to do this, but I would be fine if we recess we control F office to department reprinted this piece of paper and gave us this fledgling department that we could all feel really good about voting on, and then have a study that built that up over the next year, you're going to have a lot of colleagues, hopefully here for another term really excited to do that work.  But that is a place that I could feel really proud of starting out, and that is all I have to say on that.  Thank you all the men with spotter.  Is there a motion to recommend approval of item seven and seven be on the agenda.  Alderman Riley is.  Yes.  Okay, roll call vote.  Vice Chair Silverstein.  Alderman King.  Alderman Harrison.
