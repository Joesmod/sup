Here is where the military recruiters are going to be is very similar to here is where the wedding is going to take place, which is what standard websites do. MR. FLETCHER: Exactly. And in saying that, I don't want to at all minimize Ms. Smith's sincere religious objection to saying that for a wedding that she opposes. I'm just making the point that the law schools also had sincere moral objections to making those statements to facilitate recruiting that they found deeply objectionable.

RESPONSE:

The conversation is about the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy, which prevented recruiters from discriminating against LGBTQ+ individuals. The policy was deeply objectionable to law schools, who felt that it violated their principles of nondiscrimination.

If they did, then they would have to do the same for everyone, which would be a burden.
