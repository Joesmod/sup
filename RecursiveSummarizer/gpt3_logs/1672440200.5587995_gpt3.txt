the purple line on the north side.  And I said we take that same vigor and energy to help the transit star communities, south of 95th Street on the red line.

It is not equal when a part of our city does not have the same access that the rest of us do, even though we're on the west side of Chicago, we would be wrong not to support, helping our brothers and sisters on the far south side, get to get the transit opportunities that they deserve, and I would like to definitely stand and support.
