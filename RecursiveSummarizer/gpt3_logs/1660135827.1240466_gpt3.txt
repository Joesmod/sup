CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The proposed rule would exempt emissions that exceed the waste emissions threshold if they are caused by unreasonable delay in environmental permitting of gathering or transmission infrastructure necessary for offtake of increased volume as a result of methane emissions mitigation implementation. Additionally, the proposed rule would exempt an applicable facility from the charge if the facility is subject to and in compliance with methane emissions requirements and if compliance with those requirements will result in equivalent or greater emissions reductions. Finally, the proposed rule would exempt emissions from any well that has been plugged in accordance with applicable regulations.
