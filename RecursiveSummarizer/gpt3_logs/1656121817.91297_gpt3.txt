Write a concise summary of the following:

prenatal life, protection of maternal health, elimination of certain medical procedures, mitigation of fetal pain, and others. Ante, at 78. This Court will surely face critical questions about how that test applies. Must a state law allow abortions when necessary to protect a womans life and health? And if so, exactly when? How much risk to a womans life can a State force  pressive. The majority says that lower courts have split over how to apply the undue burden standard to parental notification laws. See ante, at 60, and n. 54. But that is not so. The state law upheld had an exemption for minors demonstrating adequate maturity, whereas the ones struck down did not. Compare Planned Parenthood of Blue Ridge v. Camblos, 155 F. 3d 352, 383384 (CA4 1998), with Planned Parenthood of Ind. & Ky., Inc. v. Adams, 937 F. 3d 973, 981 (CA7 2019), cert. granted, judgment vacated, 591 U. S. ___ (2020), and Planned Parenthood, Sioux Falls Clinic v. Miller, 63 F. 3d 1452, 1460 (CA8 1995). The majority says there is a split about bans on certain types of abortion procedures. See ante, at 61, and n. 55. But the one court to have separated itself on that issue did so based on a set of factual findings significantly different from those in other cases. Compare Whole Womans Health v. Paxton, 10 F. 4th 430, 447453 (CA5 2021), with EMW Womens Surgical Center, P.S.C. v. Friedlander, 960 F. 3d 785, 798806 (CA6 2020), and West Ala. Womens Center v. Williamson, 900 F. 3d 1310, 13221324 (CA11 2018). Finally, the majority says there is a split about whether an increase in travel time to reach a clinic is an undue burden. See ante, at 61, and n. 56. But the cases to which the majority refers predate this Courts decision in Whole Womans Health v. Hellerstedt, 579 U. S. 582 (2016), which clarified how to apply the undue burden standard to that context.  36 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting her to incur, before the Fourteenth Amendments protection of life kicks in? Suppose a patient with pulmonary hypertension has a 30-to-50 percent risk of dying with ongoing pregnancy; is that enough? And short of death, how much illness or injury can the State require her to accept, consistent with the Amendments protection of liberty and equality? Further, the Court may face questions about the application of abortion regulations to medical care most people view as quite different from abortion. What about the morning-after pill? IUDs? In vitro fertilization? And how about the use of dilation and evacuation or medication for miscarriage management? See generally L. Harris, Navigating Loss of Abortion ServicesA Large Academic Medical Center Prepares for the Overturn of Roe v. Wade, 386 New England J. Med. 2061 (2022).12 Finally, the majoritys ruling today invites a host of questions about interstate conflicts. See supra, at 3; see generally D. Cohen, G. Donley, & R. Rebouch, The New Abortion Battleground,

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court has ruled that state laws regulating abortion are constitutional, as long as they do not place an undue burden on the woman's right to choose. This ruling will likely result in more state laws regulating abortion, including laws requiring parental notification and banning certain types of abortion procedures. These laws may cause conflict between states, as some states will have more restrictive laws than others.
