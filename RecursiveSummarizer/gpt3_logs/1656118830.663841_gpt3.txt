Only then did the opinion conclude that “the Framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendment counted the right to keep and bear arms among those fundamental rights necessary to our system of ordered liberty.” Id., at 778; see also id., at 822–850 (THOMAS, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (surveying history and reaching the same result under the Fourteenth Amendment’s Privileges or Immunities Clause). Timbs and McDonald concerned the question whether the Fourteenth Amendment protects rights that are expressly set out in the Bill of Rights, and it would be anomalous if similar historical support were not required when a putative right is not mentioned anywhere in the Constitution. Thus, in Glucksberg, which held that the Due Process Clause does not confer a right to assisted suicide, the Court surveyed more than 700 years of “Anglo-American common law tradition,” 521 U. S., at 711, and made clear that a fundamental right must be “objectively, deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition,” id., at 720–721. Historical inquiries of this nature are essential whenever we are asked to recognize a new component of the “liberty” protected by the Due Process Clause because the term “liberty” alone provides little guidance. “Liberty” is a capacious term.

DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Fourteenth Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms, as affirmed in the case of McDonald v. Chicago. In order to determine whether this right is fundamental, the Supreme Court looks to historical evidence such as the debates in Congress at the time of the Amendment's ratification, state constitutions in effect at that time, and federal laws enacted during the same period. The Court has found that the right to keep and bear arms is deeply rooted in our history and tradition and is essential to our system of ordered liberty.
