Because the Court has vindicated [the] principle over and over that (no matter the sentiment in 1868) there is a realm of personal liberty which the government may not enterespecially relating to bodily integrity and family life. Id., at 847, 849, 851. Casey described in detail the Courts contraception cases. See id., at 848849, 851853. It noted decisions protecting the right to marry, including to someone of another race. See id., at 847848 ([I]nterracial marriage was illegal in most States in the 19th century, but the Court was no doubt correct in finding it to be an aspect of liberty protected against state interference). In reviewing decades and decades of constitutional law, Casey could draw but one conclusion: Whatever was true in 1868, [i]t is settled now, as it was when the Court heard arguments in Roe v. Wade, that the Constitution places limits on a States right to interfere with a persons most basic decisions about family and parenthood. Id., at 849. And that conclusion still held good, until the Courts intervention here. It was settled at the time of Roe, settled at the time of Casey, and settled yesterday that the Constitution places limits on a States power to assert control over an individuals body and most personal decisionmaking. A multitude of decisions supporting that principle led to Roes recognition and Caseys reaffirmation of the right to choose; and Roe and Casey in turn supported additional protections for intimate and familial relations.

So apparently, the Fourteenth Amendment might provide protection for things wholly unknown in the 19th century; maybe one day there could be constitutional protection for, oh, time travel. But as to anything that was known back then (such as abortion or contraception), no such luck.   20 DOBBS v.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

The majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization overrules Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood, effectively eliminating the constitutional right to abortion. The opinion relies on the premise that the right to abortion is not constitutionally protected because it was not recognized as such in 1868 when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified. This logic is problematic because it would also preclude the recognition of other rights that were not recognized in the 19th century, such as the right to marry someone of another race. In addition, the majority opinion provides no justification for overruling Roe and Casey other than the fact that abortion was not recognized as a constitutional right in 1868.
