the abortion debate. The national division has not ended. In recent years, a significant number of States have enacted abortion restrictions that directly conflict with Roe. Those laws cannot be dismissed as political stunts or as outlier laws. Those numerous state laws collectively represent the sincere and deeply held views of tens of millions of Americans who continue to fervently believe that allowing abortions up to 24 weeks is far too radical and far too extreme, and does not sufficiently account for what Roe itself recognized as the States important and legitimate interest in protecting fetal life. 410 U. S., at 162. In this case, moreover, a majority of the States26 in allask the Court to overrule Roe and return the abortion issue to the States.  In short, Caseys stare decisis analysis rested in part on a predictive judgment about the future development of state laws and of the peoples views on the abortion issue. But that predictive judgment has not borne out. As the Court today explains, the experience over the last 30 years conflicts with Caseys predictive judgment and therefore undermines Caseys precedential force.5 In any event, although Casey is relevant to the stare decisis analysis, the question of whether to overrule Roe cannot be dictated by Casey alone. To illustrate that stare decisis point, consider an example. Suppose that in 1924 this Court had expressly reaffirmed Plessy v. Ferguson and upheld the States authority to segregate people on the basis of race. Would the Court in Brown some 30 years later in  5To be clear, public opposition to a prior decision is not a basis for overruling (or reaffirming) that decision. Rather, the question of whether to overrule a precedent must be analyzed under this Courts traditional stare decisis factors. The only point here is that Casey adopted a special stare decisis principle with respect to Roe based on the idea of resolving the national controversy and ending the national division over abortion. The continued and significant opposition to Roe, as reflected in the laws and positions of numerous States, is relevant to assessing Casey on its own terms.  10 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION KAVANAUGH, J., concurring 1954 have reaffirmed Plessy and upheld racially segregated schools simply because of that intervening 1924 precedent? Surely the answer is no. In sum, I agree with the Courts application today of the principles of stare decisis and its conclusion that Roe should be overruled. III After todays decision, the nine Members of this Court will no longer decide the basic legality of pre-viability abortion for all 330 million Americans. That issue will be resolved by the people and their representatives in the democratic process in the States or Congress. But the parties arguments have raised other related questions, and I address some of them here. First is the question of how this decision will affect other precedents involving issues such as

RESPONSE:

The abortion debate in the United States has been ongoing for many years, with no clear end in sight. In recent years, a number of states have passed laws restricting abortion, which directly conflict with the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade. These laws cannot be dismissed as simply political stunts or as outliers; they represent the sincere beliefs of millions of Americans who believe that allowing abortions up to 24 weeks is too radical and extreme, and does not take into account the state's interest in protecting fetal life. The question of whether or not to overturn Roe v. Wade is not dictated by Casey v. Planned Parenthood alone; other factors must be considered as well. Public opposition to Roe is one such factor. In light of this continued opposition, as well as the conflicting predictive judgments about the future of state laws and public opinion on abortion, the Supreme Court has decided to overturn Roe v. Wade.
