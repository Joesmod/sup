had been found to spring from no fewer than five different constitutional provisionsthe First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments. Id., at 152. The Courts discussion left open at least three ways in which some combination of these provisions could protect the abortion right. One possibility was that the right was founded . . . in the Ninth Amendments reservation of rights to the people. Id., at 153. Another was that the right was rooted in the First, Fourth, or Fifth Amendment, or in some combination of those provisions, and that this right had been incorporated into the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment just as many other Bill of Rights provisions had by then been incorporated. Ibid; see   10 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court also McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U. S. 742, 763766 (2010) (majority opinion) (discussing incorporation). And a third path was that the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments played no role and that the right was simply a component of the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause. Roe, 410 U. S., at 153. Roe expressed the feel[ing] that the Fourteenth Amendment was the provision that did the work, but its message seemed to be that the abortion right could be found somewhere in the Constitution and that specifying its exact location was not of paramount importance.16 The Casey Court did not defend this unfocused analysis and instead grounded its decision solely on the theory that the right to obtain an abortion is part of the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause. We discuss this theory in depth below, but before doing so, we briefly address one additional constitutional provision that some of respondents amici have now offered as yet another potential home for the abortion right: the Fourteenth Amendments Equal Protection Clause. See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24 (Brief for United States); see also Brief for Equal Protection Constitutional Law Scholars as Amici Curiae. Neither Roe nor Casey saw fit to invoke this theory, and it is squarely foreclosed by our precedents, which establish that a States regulation of abortion is not a sex-based classification and is thus not subject to the heightened scrutiny that applies to such classifications.17 The regulation of a medical procedure that  16The Courts words were as follows: This right of privacy, whether it be founded in the Fourteenth Amendments concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action, as we feel it is, or, as the District Court determined, in the Ninth Amendments reservation of rights to the people, is broad enough to encompass a womans decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. 410 U.

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Court in Roe v. Wade found that the right to abortion springs from at least five different constitutional provisions, and that it could be rooted in the First, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth, or Fourteenth Amendments. The Court in Casey v. Planned Parenthood did not defend Roe's unfocused analysis, and instead grounded its decision solely on the theory that the right to obtain an abortion is part of the liberty protected by the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. However, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not apply to abortion, as it is not a sex-based classification.
