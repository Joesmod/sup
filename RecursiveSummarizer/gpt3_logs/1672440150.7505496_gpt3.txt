will be done in earth as it is in heaven.  We come to you, dear Lord, because you are the only one with power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessings, which we so desperately need.  Moreover, it is you who have made us and not we ourselves.  We're your people, the sheep of your pasture.  So we enter into your gates with thanksgiving, enter your courts with praise.
