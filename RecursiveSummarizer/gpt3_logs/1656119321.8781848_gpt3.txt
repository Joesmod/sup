DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

In 1883, the State of Tennessee passed a law making it a criminal offense to terminate a pregnancy, with a punishment of up to five years in prison. The law was aimed at preventing abortions, but it also had the effect of criminalizing miscarriages. In 1910, the State of Kentucky passed a similar law, with a maximum punishment of up to five years in prison. In 2012, the State of Mississippi passed a law that would have made it a criminal offense to terminate a pregnancy, with a punishment of up to 10 years in prison. The law was challenged in court, and in 2017 the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit struck down the law, saying that it was unconstitutional. In 2020, the State of Louisiana passed a law that would make it a criminal offense to terminate a pregnancy, with a punishment of up to 10 years in prison. The law was challenged in court, and in 2021 the United States Supreme Court struck down the law, saying that it was unconstitutional.
