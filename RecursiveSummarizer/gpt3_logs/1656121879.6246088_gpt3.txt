Write a concise summary of the following:

shaken if they lost respect for this Court as an institution that decides important cases based on principle, not social and political pressures. There is a special   56 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting danger that the public will perceive a decision as having been made for unprincipled reasons when the Court overrules a controversial watershed decision, such as Roe. A decision overruling Roe would be perceived as having been made under fire and as a surrender to political pressure. Ante, at 6667 (citations omitted). That seems to us a good description. And it seems to us right. The majority responds (if we understand it correctly): well, yes, but we have to apply the law. See ante, at 67. To which Casey would have said: That is exactly the point. Here, more than anywhere, the Court needs to apply the lawparticularly the law of stare decisis. Here, we know that citizens will continue to contest the Courts decision, because [m]en and women of good conscience deeply disagree about abortion. Casey, 505 U. S., at 850. When that contestation takes placebut when there is no legal basis for reversing coursethe Court needs to be steadfast, to stand its ground. That is what the rule of law requires. And that is what respect for this Court depends on. The promise of constancy, once given in so charged an environment, Casey explained, binds its maker for as long as the understanding of the issue has not changed so fundamentally as to render the commitment obsolete. Id., at 868. A breach of that promise is nothing less than a breach of faith. Ibid. [A]nd no Court that broke its faith with the people could sensibly expect credit for principle. Ibid. No Court breaking its faith in that way would deserve credit for principle. As one of Caseys authors wrote in another case, Our legitimacy requires, above all, that we adhere to stare decisis in sensitive political contexts where partisan controversy abounds. Bush v. Vera, 517 U. S. 952, 985 (1996) (opinion of OConnor, J.). Justice Jackson once called a decision he dissented from a loaded weapon, ready to hand for improper uses. Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.

S. ____ (2022) 57 BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting that todays decision, departing from stare decisis for no legitimate reason, is its own loaded weapon. Weakening stare decisis threatens to upend bedrock legal doctrines, far beyond any single decision. Weakening stare decisis creates profound legal instability. And as Casey recognized, weakening stare decisis in a hotly contested case like this one calls into question this Courts commitment to legal principle. It makes the Court appear not restrained but aggressive, not modest but grasping. In all those ways, todays decision takes aim, we fear, at the rule of law. III Power, not reason, is the new currency of this Courts decisionmaking. Payne, 501

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The three dissenting justices in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization case argue that the majority's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade is a breach of faith that will damage the Court's legitimacy. They argue that the Court should have adhered to stare decisis, or the principle of precedent, in this case, as it is a highly charged and controversial issue. Justice Jackson once called a decision he dissented from a loaded weapon, ready to hand for improper uses. Korematsu v. United States, 323 U. S. 214, 246 (1944). The dissenters argue that the majority's decision today is its own loaded weapon.
