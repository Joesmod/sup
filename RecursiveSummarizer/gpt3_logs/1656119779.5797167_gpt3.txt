But here is the rub. The law also did not then (and would not for ages) protect a wealth of other things. It did not protect the rights recognized in Lawrence and Obergefell to same-sex intimacy and marriage. It did not protect the right recognized in Loving to marry across racial lines. It did not protect the right recognized in Griswold to contraceptive use. For that matter, it did not protect the right recognized in Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson, 316 U. S. 535 (1942), not to be sterilized without consent. So if the majority is right in its legal analysis, all those decisions were wrong, and all those matters properly belong to the States too—whatever the particular state interests involved. And if that is true, it is impossible to understand (as a matter of logic and principle) how the majority can say that its opinion today does not threaten—does not even “undermine”—any number of other constitutional rights.

Still, the future significance of today’s opinion will be decided in the future. And law often has a way of evolving —————— not conceive of the abortion decision as implicating liberty, because the law in the 19th century gave that choice no protection. The trouble is that the chosen path—which is, again, the solitary rationale for the Court’s decision—provides no way to distinguish between the right to choose an abortion and a range of other rights, including contraception. 8The majority briefly (very briefly) gestures at the idea that some stare decisis factors might play out differently with respect to these other constitutional rights. But the majority gives no hint as to why. And the majority’s (mis)treatment of stare decisis in this case provides little reason to think that the doctrine would stand as a barrier to the majority’s redoing any other decision it considered egregiously wrong.

DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization argues that the Fourteenth Amendment does not protect a woman's right to choose an abortion. The majority reasoning is that the law in the 19th century did not protect a woman's right to choose an abortion, and therefore, the Fourteenth Amendment does not protect that right either. The dissent argues that the majority opinion is based on a false premise, namely that the law in the 19th century did not protect a woman's right to choose an abortion. The dissent points out that the law in the 19th century also did not protect a number of other rights, including the right to same-sex intimacy, the right to marry across racial lines, and the right to use contraception. The dissent argues that if the majority is correct in its legal analysis, then all of these other rights are also properly left to the states. The dissent also argues that the majority opinion provides no way to distinguish between the right to choose an abortion and a range of other rights.
