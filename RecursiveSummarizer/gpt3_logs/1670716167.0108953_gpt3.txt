And lastly article seven calls for the city to be guided by the seven principles outlined by the U.S.  interagency council on homelessness to address homelessness in Chicago.  And with that I'm happy to answer any questions.  Thank you Director Parks.  Alderman Harrison.  Thank you.  So how long did it take your team to put this together and how many members? A lot in many months.  Okay and so we received the first copy at 10 13 pm and the other one was sent out at 7 30 am.  So I will say this on the substitute that there was a lot of discussion of different so the original of course was introduced on the 26th at city council.  Then you know after everyone has reviewed it there was different feedback that we had around different adjustments and clarifications and so that went all the way to yesterday.  So but I the what I want to highlight here is the turnaround time and the unfairness as it goes to the alderman having received 39 pages last night at 10 pm or whatever the additional ones were this morning.  You know this is important legislation for the city.  It was important for you to have a team of people to work on it and to review and we should be afforded the same opportunity.  That's my comment on that.  All right so starting on page eight.  The duty to cooperate.  You added the the lobbyist engaged in the lobbying of elected or appointed city officers or employees.
