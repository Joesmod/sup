there should be an exploration to think about what sustainable revenue sources can maintain the department in the long term.  So that's another scope of the study, and really understanding I think the functions now right people were there are 250 people that work in some capacity on environmental issues in the city of Chicago is from tree planters to people that are working on, you know, flooding and green infrastructure to policy folks to people that work on low carbon mobility.  And of course, Dr.  Arw you know, we have a lot of questions about the department and we want to make sure that we are engaging people properly to understand where the gaps and services are and where we can continue to build capacity.  Well, and I just and with that because I got another question but I, I find it concerning that we putting these such an important part of this in any kind of pro bono, these must be fully funded.  There's a lot of opportunity here if there's about a revenue, because you have a lot of Amazon facilities around when they're doing so well.  I do think that we should start taxing them if that's the issue.  But what we cannot continue to do is to allow these polluters to do as they please and as we continue doing study after study after study.  We know what we need to do.  So again, I will seriously ask the budget.  I mean we're not even reestablishing the department as was planned promise, but I think basic consideration that must be given, because these permits keep being awarded.  As you know there's one already right now that is spending and these studies are critical so I would like to and I will challenge that to make sure that we have a fully funded and properly funded so that we have a real guidance on this.  So that question has to do with the vacancies in the police department.  Do we have, I know that there's other colleagues that are talking about this.  In terms of the two things where I also see discussions about capital planning or assessments on
