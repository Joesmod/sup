Write a concise summary of the following:

woman's right to choose to terminate a pregnancy extends up to the point that the fetus is viable outside the womb. This ruling overturns the previous rule from Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood, which had anchored a woman's right to abortion to viability. The new ruling is based on the principle of judicial restraint, and the Court has acknowledged that it erred in Roe in adopting viability as the earliest point at which a State may legislate to advance its interests in the area of abortion.  The Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark decision that legalized abortion in the United States. In a close 5-4 decision, the Court ruled that states may now ban abortion outright or place severe restrictions on the procedure. The decision is a major victory for anti-abortion activists and a devastating blow to women's reproductive rights.  The Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade held that the state has an interest in protecting potential life, but cannot force a woman to carry a child to term when she would have chosen an early abortion. In Casey v. Planned Parenthood, the Court held that the state has a significant interest in disallowing abortions after viability, but still cannot place an undue burden on a woman seeking an abortion prior to viability. The majority opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization scoffs at the idea of balancing interests, castigating the dissent for repeatedly praising the balance the two cases arrived at. The majority would allow States to ban abortion from conception onward because it does not think forced childbirth at all implicates a woman's rights to equality and freedom.  The Constitution of the United States is written in such a way that it can adapt to changing circumstances over time. This has allowed the Constitution to protect women's rights, even though it did not do so in 1868. The Constitution subjects discrimination against women to heightened judicial scrutiny and guarantees access to contraception. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that every adult has the right to determine what shall be done with their own body, including medical decisions or procedures. This right extends to women, who have the right to choose whether or not to have an abortion.  The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that a right to use and gain access to contraception is part of the Fourteenth Amendments guarantee of liberty, and that abortion bans are therefore constitutionally mandated. However, the Court's reasoning provides no way to distinguish between the right to choose an abortion and other rights, including those recognized in previous decisions. As a result, the Court's decision threatens a number of other constitutional rights.  The Supreme Court has ruled that state laws regulating abortion are constitutional, as long as they do not place an undue burden on the woman's right to choose. This ruling will likely result in more state laws regulating abortion, including laws requiring parental
