Write a concise summary of the following:

principles to be applied by the courts.  The Supreme Court has overruled Roe v. Wade and Casey v. Planned Parenthood, two landmark decisions that guaranteed a woman's right to an abortion. The Court's decision is based on the principle of stare decisis, which dictates that precedent should be followed unless there is a compelling reason to do otherwise. The majority opinion argues that Roe and Casey are no longer workable because they have been eroded by changes in law and fact. However, the dissent argues that the standards set forth in Roe and Casey are perfectly workable and that there is no justification for overruling them.  The Casey undue burden standard is the same as the general standards that courts work with daily in other legal spheres. It is not unusual or difficult to apply, and has only provoked disagreement among judges on a few occasions. The majority's substitute standard, that a law regulating or banning abortion must be rational in order to serve legitimate state interests, is too broad and will lead to more disagreement and confusion.  The Supreme Court has ruled that state laws regulating abortion are constitutional, as long as they do not place an undue burden on the woman's right to choose. This ruling will likely result in more state laws regulating abortion, including laws requiring parental notification and banning certain types of abortion procedures. These laws may cause conflict between states, as some states will have more restrictive laws than others.  In 123 Colum. L. Rev. (forthcoming 2023), the author discusses whether a state can bar women from traveling to another state to obtain an abortion. They conclude that while the Constitution protects travel and speech, the majority ruling today puts the Court at the center of the coming interjurisdictional abortion wars.  The majority opinion in the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization case throws out longstanding precedent without justification and ignores the fact that Roe and Casey are still the law of the land. This will have profound consequences for women's rights, including the right to choose whether or not to have an abortion.  The Supreme Court has ruled that insurance coverage is available for healthcare services, but that many women continue to face pregnancy discrimination that makes it difficult for them to earn a living. Paid family leave remains inaccessible to many who need it most, and the majority of private-sector workers do not have access to it. Black women are three to four times more likely to die during or after childbirth than white women.  A study of women who sought an abortion but were denied one because of gestational limits found that only 9 percent put the child up for adoption, rather than parenting themselves. The majority notes the claim that people now have a new appreciation of fetal life, partly because of viewing sonogram images. However, the majority's reasoning does not rely on any reevaluation of the interest in
