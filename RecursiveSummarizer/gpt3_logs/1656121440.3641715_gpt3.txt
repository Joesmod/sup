Write a concise summary of the following:

Obergefell (same-sex marriage). Perhaps this is  38 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION Opinion of the Court designed to stoke unfounded fear that our decision will imperil those other rights, but the dissents analogy is objectionable for a more important reason: what it reveals about the dissents views on the protection of what Roe called potential life. The exercise of the rights at issue in Griswold, Eisenstadt, Lawrence, and Obergefell does not destroy a potential life, but an abortion has that effect. So if the rights at issue in those cases are fundamentally the same as the right recognized in Roe and Casey, the implication is clear: The Constitution does not permit the States to regard the destruction of a potential life as a matter of any significance. That view is evident throughout the dissent. The dissent has much to say about the effects of pregnancy on women, the burdens of motherhood, and the difficulties faced by poor women. These are important concerns. However, the dissent evinces no similar regard for a States interest in protecting prenatal life. The dissent repeatedly praises the balance, post, at 2, 6, 8, 10, 12, that the viability line strikes between a womans liberty interest and the States interest in prenatal life. But for reasons we discuss later, see infra, at 5054, 5556, and given in the opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE, post, at 25 (opinion concurring in judgment), the viability line makes no sense. It was not adequately justified in Roe, and the dissent does not even try to defend it today. Nor does it identify any other point in a pregnancy after which a State is permitted to prohibit the destruction of a fetus. Our opinion is not based on any view about if and when prenatal life is entitled to any of the rights enjoyed after birth. The dissent, by contrast, would impose on the people a particular theory about when the rights of personhood begin. According to the dissent, the Constitution requires the States to regard a fetus as lacking even the most basic human rightto liveat least until an arbitrary point in a pregnancy has passed. Nothing in the Constitution or in Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 39 Opinion of the Court our Nations legal traditions authorizes the Court to adopt that theory of life. Post, at 8. III We next consider whether the doctrine of stare decisis counsels continued acceptance of Roe and Casey. Stare decisis plays an important role in our case law, and we have explained that it serves many valuable ends. It protects the interests of those who have taken action in reliance on a past decision. See Casey, 505 U. S., at 856 (joint opinion); see also Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 828 (1991). It reduces incentives for challenging settled precedents, saving parties and courts the expense of endless relitigation. Kimble, 576 U. S., at 455. It fosters evenhanded decisionmaking by requiring that like cases be decided in a like manner. Payne, 501 U. S., at 827. It

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court has ruled that the right to same-sex marriage is protected by the Constitution, in a decision that strikes down state bans on such unions. The court's ruling is based on the principle of stare decisis, which holds that past decisions should be respected. This principle protects the interests of those who have taken action in reliance on past decisions, reduces incentives for challenging settled precedents, and fosters evenhanded decisionmaking.
