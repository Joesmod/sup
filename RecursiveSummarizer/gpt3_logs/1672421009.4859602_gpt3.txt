Extract names of goverment proposals from the following text:


was not filled.  And over the last month, been talking to veteran advocates around reinstating it and so I appreciate that.  I want to make sure that this position is identified as the director of Chicago Veteran Affairs and also staffed to make sure that we're dealing with the thousands of returning citizens that are that have fought and served this country and making sure that they're providing services for them the much needed services that, quite frankly, they deserve.  And so, I want to see that budget amendment, I want to see that budget amendment titled with Chicago Office of Veteran Affairs with a dollar amount that's a lot of work that's appropriate and, and deserving as my budget amendment was for 400,000.  I'm always willing to negotiate, but you can't be a director without nobody to direct.  And so we want to make sure that there's people there that are able to help veterans and making sure that they're welcome back to the city that that they've been listed from.  So, I want to make sure that this is a discussion.  Yes, it's a quest I want to put on the record, because I had 35 plus co sponsors and the other reason why I couldn't get the other 14 because I didn't see them.  But in the discussion I had with the members and this body.  It was overwhelmingly supported and I want to make sure that's reflected these men and women that fight for our for our freedom deserve this, and more.  Thank you, Alderman Villegas Alderman Austin.  Thank you.  Susie I'll just say one, it's been an honor to work with you as a budget director.  I appreciate your working with us.  These positive things I'll point out in the edits that are in here one is the going from 800 units to 1200 units for rapid rehousing, which is going to get, you know, 400 more people, actually, I think it was 400 last year in the introduced budget it was 800 now it's going to 1200.  And that's going to streamline getting people off the street and into housing so I think that's critically important.
