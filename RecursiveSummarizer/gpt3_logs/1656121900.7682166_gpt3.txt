violates the First Amendment, and overruling Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U. S. 209 (1977), based on both factual and legal developments that had eroded the decisions underpinnings and left it an outlier among our First Amendment cases (internal quotation marks omitted)); Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U. S. 644, 659663 (2015) (holding that the Fourteenth Amendment protects the right of same-sex couples to marry in light of doctrinal developments, as well as fundamentally changed social understanding); Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U. S. 558, 572578 (2003) (overruling Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U. S. 186 (1986), after finding anti-sodomy laws to be inconsistent with the Fourteenth Amendment in light of developments in the legal doctrine, as well as changed social understanding of sexuality); United States v. Scott, 437 U. S. 82, 101 (1978) (overruling United States v. Jenkins, 420 U. S. 358 (1975), three years after it was decided, because of developments in the Courts double jeopardy case law, and because intervening practice had shown that government appeals from midtrial dismissals requested by the defendant were practicable, desirable, and consistent with double jeopardy values); Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 197199, 210, n. 23 (1976) (holding that sex-based classifications are subject to intermediate BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting Cite as: 597 U.

S. 71 (1971), and other equal protection cases and social changes had overtaken any inconsistent suggestion in Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U. S. 464 (1948)); Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U. S. 522, 535537 (1975) (recognizing as a foregone conclusion from the pattern of some of the Courts cases over the past 30 years, as well as from legislative developments at both federal and state levels, that women could not be excluded from jury service, and explaining that the prior decision approving such practice, Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U. S. 57 (1961), had been rendered inconsistent with equal protection jurisprudence). Other overrulings occurred very close in time to the original decision so did not engender substantial reliance and could not be described as having been embedded as part of our national culture. Dickerson v. United States, 530 U. S. 428, 443 (2000); see Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808 (1991) (revising procedural rules of evidence that had barred admission of certain victim-impact evidence during the penalty phase of capital cases, and overruling South Carolina v.
