filing of charges or indictment department by government agency removal from office.  The rationales that this type of behavior obstructs the operation and functioning of the whole government that at some point they wish to do business with.  In 2009, as of January 6 2022, more than 725 people have been arrested for storming the US Capitol building on January 6 2021.  While the judicial system is carrying out justice to city Chicago has additional avenues to not only hold these individuals and businesses accountable, but also no longer allow for such individuals in businesses to benefit from taxpayer dollars, dollars and community opportunities.  This was the first federal was the first federal jury conviction of what likely would be many convictions to come that originated from the January 6 2021 insurrection.  These individuals and businesses must be held accountable at every level.  And I ask for passage of this item is the chairman, after my colleague from the 42nd room speaks.  Thank you, Chairman Vegas, President Pro Tem Farley.  Thank you, Chairman.  I just wanted to echo all of chairman Vegas his comments and to compliment him for bringing this ordinance forward I was happy to co sponsor this with him and certainly support the substitute changes that include hate crimes as covered by the prohibition.  For all of those reasons, I'd encourage my colleagues to vote I but, again, there's little that local governments can do.  When it comes to acts of federal sedition however, we can put our foot down and send a strong message to those individuals and families who employ them that we're watching, and that if you're going to take action against our government and against classes of people in our society, and you're convicted as such, you won't have the privilege to do business with the city of Chicago so thank you chairman Vegas for the ordinance and thank you chairman.  I strongly support this and look forward to voting I would like to thank you for bringing this
