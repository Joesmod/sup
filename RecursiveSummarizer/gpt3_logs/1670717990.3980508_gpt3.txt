PROMPT:

Write an explanation as to how the following will benefit the City:


providing the the units on site so we can go to the next slide and uh...  this is the this is up yeah this is unfortunately a poor quality image but i have uh...  you all should have received a summary one one or two page summary that had this data in in the summary so you can refer to that and see uh...  actually we can we can just page over to the next this is the summary of of the uh...  the current property taxes are zero the property is vacant unimproved and exempt so there it's not generating any property property taxes currently the total property taxes over uh...  the thirty-year term of this program is around twenty six million uh...  the property taxes with that that's without the incentive and then with the incentive it would be seventeen million so we're uh...  uh...  enjoying uh...  uh...  reduction in total tax savings of around nine million the cost of providing the twenty percent affordable units on site is roughly twelve million so uh...  you can see the math here that this is closing coming close to closing the gap of the cost of providing twenty percent of affordable units on site and that's our presentation uh...  lots of questions i know my the my committee members have let me start by saying this uh...  the general assembly i believe two or three years ago passed a law uh...  that it provided this property tax break the assessor's office in the county uh...  evaluated that came up with their rules on how to administer it the map that showed the downtown loop area is kind of an area that by right is able to take advantage of this benefit the only other development like this to date that we've done is the glenstar on the northwest side uh...  near o'hare that was kind of administered by the city uh...  this is the first of our in our committee but we're gonna have many more of these in in the months and years to come it's my hope to have a briefing with the assessor's office and housing department to kind of talk through the nuances of this uh...


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The City will benefit from this by receiving a reduction in property taxes of around 9 million over the 30-year term of the program. The cost of providing the 20% affordable units on site is roughly 12 million, so this will help to close the gap of the cost of providing affordable units.
