Write a concise summary of the following:


throughout the city doing a great job representing your department as well.  So thank you, Madam Chairman.  Thank you, Alderman.  Thank you, Alderman.  I think that your questions regarding care and follow up on the migrants could be addressed to the Brandy Kanazi, the Commissioner of the Department of Family and Support Services after this meeting.  Okay.  Alderman Brookins.  Thank you, Madam Chairman.  Just a quick note.  I don't know, I understand that there's a problem with what my colleagues say with respect to tax ID numbers, et cetera.  The city can resolve that.  I don't know that we need a special tax ID number.  The city should just set up accounts for each individual ward and utilities could be taken out because they shouldn't be charging us taxes.  When we do it, we get taxed.  When we pay for, when we pay for Zoom, we get taxed.  The city doesn't reimburse us for the tax portion.  So we end up eating it.  What they need to do, the city from the various departments, is to get those contracts for ward office specific.  Then we will not be taxed saving the taxpayer and the Alderman money.  And they could be transitioned from ward to ward to ward.  Thank you, Alderman Brookins.  That's similar to what Alderman Zalasi Garza was asking the commissioner to look into.  So I'm sure she's writing that down and will get back to us at some point.  Can I get a motion to recommend approval? Move by a motion made by Alderman Brookins recommending do pass all those in favor signify by saying aye.  Opposed.  The do pass, the ayes have it.  The do pass motion appointing you commissioner, Sandra Blake Moore as commissioner of assets, information and services will be reported out at the next city council meeting.  Thank you very much.  And congratulations.  Thank you so much.  Item number two on the agenda is an ordinance introduced by Alderman Michelle Harris, eighth ward concerning the transfer of funds from within her committee on committee on rules for the year 2022.
