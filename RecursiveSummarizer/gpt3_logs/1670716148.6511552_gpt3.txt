PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


very close if not there, we have planted 15,000 trees, primarily in priority communities in this year alone.  And so that's the type of work that we have been doing in the office currently in two years with five people.  We are going to continue to expand our capacity, and to continue to build toward a more permanent structure.  We know that all of those things still need our time and our energy.  And in addition to that we're going to continue working with departments like AIS, who have, you know, we just worked with them on a brand new renewable energy contract we will be delivering 100% renewable energy to the city for our municipal load by 2025 that is going to come with a community benefits agreement that we will put back into community and workforce development.  So there's a lot of work that we've been building over the last two years.  We're very excited to continue that momentum.  And we're very excited to explore the study to decide once and for all what a permanent structure will look like for the Department of Environment.  We know that this is a delicate situation.  We know that a lot of stakeholders need to be engaged.  And we also feel very strongly, excuse me, the coordinating entity and a department are necessary.  Can you shorten your answers.  We got a lot on the plate today.  Thank you.  So it's your sense that going this particular pathway will not slow down our efforts to work in our environment.  I think that the increased capacity will continue to build the momentum and this will move us in the right direction.  Thank you.  And it's a very complicated answer because it involves multiple departments so that makes sense as well and I'm thankful that again you're very focused on the use of evidence based best practices and your data driven.  Great.  Thank you.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Thank you, Alderman Capelman, I wanted to move this forward list, Alderman LaSparta, do you have a short question.  I'll keep it off a question I'll take all of
