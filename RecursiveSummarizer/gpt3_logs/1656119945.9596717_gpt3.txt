Write a detailed summary of the following:

U. S., at 844 (Marshall, J., dissenting). Roe has stood for fifty years. Casey, a precedent about precedent specifically confirming Roe, has stood for thirty. And the doctrine of stare decisis—a critical element of the rule of law—stands foursquare behind their continued existence. The right those decisions established and preserved is embedded in our constitutional law, both originating in and leading to other rights protecting bodily integrity, personal autonomy, and family relationships. The abortion right is also embedded in the lives of women— shaping their expectations, influencing their choices about relationships and work, supporting (as all reproductive rights do) their social and economic equality. Since the right’s recognition (and affirmation), nothing has changed to support what the majority does today. Neither law nor facts nor attitudes have provided any new reasons to reach a different result than Roe and Casey did. All that has changed is this Court. Mississippi—and other States too—knew exactly what they were doing in ginning up new legal challenges to Roe and Casey. The 15-week ban at issue here was enacted in 2018. Other States quickly followed: Between 2019 and 2021, eight States banned abortion procedures after six to  58 DOBBS v.

DETAILED SUMMARY:

RESPONSE:

The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the right to abortion for 50 years, and the doctrine of stare decisis supports the continued existence of this right. The right to abortion is embedded in our constitutional law and is also shaped by the lives of women. In 2018, Mississippi enacted a ban on abortion procedures after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Other states quickly followed suit. In 2019, Mississippi decided that it had not gone far enough and passed a 6-week restriction. A state senator who championed both Mississippi laws said that the obvious goal was to test the limits of Roe v. Wade. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court signaled that Mississippi's stratagem would succeed. Texas was one of the first states to ban abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. It added to that restriction an unprecedented scheme to "evade judicial review" of the ban. The Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization upholds Mississippi's 15-week ban and opens the door for even more restrictive abortion bans in the future.
