That fact—the presence of countervailing interests—is what made the abortion question hard, and what necessitated balancing. The majority scoffs at that idea, castigating us for “repeatedly prais[ing] the ‘balance’” the two cases arrived at (with the word “balance” in scare quotes). Ante, at 38. To the majority “balance” is a dirty word, as moderation is a foreign concept. The majority would allow States to ban abortion from conception onward because it does not think forced childbirth at all implicates a woman’s rights to equality and freedom. Today’s Court, that is, does not think there is anything of constitutional significance attached to a woman’s control of her body and the path of her life. Roe and Casey thought that one-sided view misguided. In some sense, that is the difference in a nutshell between our precedents and the majority opinion. The constitutional regime we have lived in for the last 50 years recognized competing interests, and sought a balance between them. The constitutional regime we enter today erases the woman’s interest and recognizes only the State’s (or the Federal Government’s).

The liberty interests underlying those rights are, as we will describe, quite similar. See infra, at 22–24. But only in the sphere of abortion is the state interest in protecting potential life involved. So only in that sphere, as both Roe and Casey recognized, may a State impinge so far on the liberty interest (barring abortion after viability and discouraging it before). The majority’s failure to understand this fairly obvious point stems from its rejection of the idea of balancing interests in this (or maybe in any) constitutional context. Cf. New York State Rifle & Pistol Assn., Inc. v. Bruen, 597 U. S. ___, ___, ___–___ (2022) (slip op., at 8, 15–17). The majority thinks that a woman has no liberty or equality interest in the decision to bear a child, so a State’s interest in protecting fetal life necessarily prevails.  Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 13 BREYER, SOTOMAYOR, and KAGAN, JJ., dissenting exist in “1868, the year when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified”? Ante, at 23. The majority says (and with this much we agree) that the answer to this question is no: In 1868, there was no nationwide right to end a pregnancy,

DETAILED SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Supreme Court has ruled that there is no nationwide right to abortion, overturning decades of precedent. The ruling will allow states to ban abortion from conception onward, with no exceptions for rape or incest. The majority opinion, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, argues that the right to abortion is not recognized in the Constitution. Thomas cites the Fourteenth Amendment, ratified in 1868, which he says does not protect a woman's right to end a pregnancy. The majority opinion also criticizes the Roe v. Wade decision, which legalized abortion nationwide, for its "balance" between a woman's right to abortion and the state's interest in protecting fetal life. Justice Stephen Breyer, writing in dissent, argues that the majority opinion is "a radical decision" that will harm women's health and equality. Breyer also criticizes the majority for its "rejection of the idea of balancing interests" in constitutional law.
