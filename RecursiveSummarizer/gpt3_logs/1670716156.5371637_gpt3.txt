Write a concise summary of the following:


agreement with the Chicago Transit Authority in Cook County for the allocation of three million dollars from the city's motor fuel tax funds to the CTA.  As background the regional transportation authority act requires the CTA to receive five million dollars from Cook County and the city of Chicago in order for the CTA to receive RTA funds.  The city provides three million of the five million annual requirement while Cook County provides the two million.  This is an annual allocation provided by the city.  Is there a motion to recommend approval of item number nine on the agenda.  So so moved by Alderman Wagesback.  All those in favor signify by saying aye.  All those opposed.  Here we'll call for a roll call.  We will take the roll.  Point of information Alderman Tunney.  This is I think our budget director said we've we've gone around and around over the years about this particular subject.  So it is a requirement.  It's not it's really not a choice and I just wanted to make sure that is confirmed because we've had our issues with CTA over a number of years but this is mandated.  I'm almost mistaken.  Yes this is not the one we want to throw the gauntlet down on because it is required by the Regional Transportation Act.  Alderman Harrison followed by Alderman Villegas.  Thank you Madam Chair.  I think the issue is the fact that we've got a letter from the president of CTA saying that he's going to appear on November 10th and people have been asking for him to appear for several months and so we're going to pass this and and I understand that we have an obligation to do so but at the same token he has an obligation to appear before this body which he has been reluctant to do.  Thank you Alderman Harrison.  Alderman Villegas.  Thank you Madam Chair.  Is there any reporting back from CTA as to the how they're going to utilize these funds? That's my only question.  This is the match that we provide the five million that you know under the RTA Act that we are required
