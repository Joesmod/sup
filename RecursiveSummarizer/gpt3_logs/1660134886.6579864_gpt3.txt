CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The bill amends the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to treat cost-sharing for covered insulin products as meeting the deductible and out-of-pocket requirements for plan years 2023 and 2024. For plan years 2025 and subsequent plan years, cost-sharing for covered insulin products is only required prior to an individual reaching the out-of-pocket threshold.
