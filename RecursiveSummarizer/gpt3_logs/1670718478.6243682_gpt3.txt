PROMPT:

Write an explanation of the following and how it is a waste of the City's money:


it's one of two ways a developer that's in the downtown area by rights can take advantage of this program the other action is that city council has to vote on in order and specific to this provision and that happened one time before with glen star development on the northwest side this is the second one uh...  but there will be more of these moving forward so i think it's kind of all done in in collaboration would be the way i'd say it incorrect me if i'm wrong uh...  after action is taken by the city council uh...  the development team would then go to the assessor and make an application and apply to the assessor for this tax benefit and this butler can clarify for that's exactly right but it is it you know keep hearing say downtown so it's just for the downtown notice so they're no so it's one of two ways the development team can take advantage of the doing development site and if emily could pull the map up on the on the screen any of these any site in the way the state statute was written development in that zone area downtown uh...  is by rights anything outside of that within the city chicago the city council has to take action where we are i would say bigger picture beyond today is that i think that there's more work uh...  that the council and department of housing have to do letting people know about the tool and how we develop it i think the other thing the city council and housing after further define is low affordability areas i think the area of the for all the men are in this is kind of a clear area that would fit under this category but i think if we look across the city and how people may want to take advantage of this i think that the part of housing in the council have to tight that up a little bit okay so if uh...  through the chair you can provide this and for me because that so we'll we'll do two things one is the the powerpoint was emailed out but we'll make sure that was is given to you again i will work to set a briefings with the assessor's


CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The city council is voting on a provision that will allow developers to take advantage of a tax benefit. This is the second time this has happened, and it is expected that there will be more in the future.
