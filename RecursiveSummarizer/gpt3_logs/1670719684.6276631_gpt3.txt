OLSON: -- they can do that, but I think what makes the hypothetical difficult is  that that assumption likely does -- does not  apply to most organizations like that that we talked -- JUSTICE BARRETT: But it seems like you can't get out of everything by defining public accommodation narrowly or broadly depending on it.
