Write a concise summary of the following:

5, 3848 (urging the Court to reject the viability rule and reverse); Reply Brief 2022 (same). The approach also finds support in prior opinions. See Webster, 492 U. S., at 518521 (plurality opinion) (abandoning key elements of the Roe framework under stare decisis while declining to reconsider Roes holding that the Constitution protects the right to an abortion).    Cite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 11 ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment The Courts decision to overrule Roe and Casey is a serious jolt to the legal systemregardless of how you view those cases. A narrower decision rejecting the misguided viability line would be markedly less unsettling, and nothing more is needed to decide this case. Our cases say that the effect of overruling a precedent on reliance interests is a factor to consider in deciding whether to take such a step, and respondents argue that generations of women have relied on the right to an abortion in organizing their relationships and planning their futures. Brief for Respondents 3641; see also Casey, 505 U. S., at 856 (making the same point). The Court questions whether these concerns are pertinent under our precedents, see ante, at 6465, but the issue would not even arise with a decision rejecting only the viability line: It cannot reasonably be argued that women have shaped their lives in part on the assumption that they would be able to abort up to viability, as opposed to fifteen weeks. In support of its holding, the Court cites three seminal constitutional decisions that involved overruling prior precedents: Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954), West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624 (1943), and West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 (1937). See ante, at 4041. The opinion in Brown was unanimous and eleven pages long; this one is neither. Barnette was decided only three years after the decision it overruled, three Justices having had second thoughts. And West Coast Hotel was issued against a backdrop of unprecedented economic despair that focused attention on the fundamental flaws of existing precedent. It also was part of a sea change in this Courts interpretation of the Constitution, signal[ing] the demise of an entire line of important precedents, ante, at 40a feature the Court expressly disclaims in todays decision, see ante, at 32, 66. None of these leading cases, in short, provides a template for what the Court does today.   12 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMENS HEALTH ORGANIZATION ROBERTS, C. J., concurring in judgment The Court says we should consider whether to overrule Roe and Casey now, because if we delay we would be forced to consider the issue again in short order. See ante, at 76 77. There would be turmoil until we did so, according to the Court, because of existing state laws with shorter deadlines or no deadline at all. Ante, at 76. But under the narrower approach proposed here, state laws outlawing abortion altogether would still violate binding

CONCISE SUMMARY:

==========

RESPONSE:

The Court overrules Roe and Casey, which established the viability rule that a woman has a right to an abortion up to the point of viability. The Court does so despite the fact that doing so will create upheaval and that a narrower decision would have sufficed. The Court cites three previous cases in which it overruled precedent, but none of them are directly analogous to the present case.
