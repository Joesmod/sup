Association's House of Delegates in February 1972 on proposed abortion legislation. Id., at 141, 144, 146 (emphasis deleted). Also noted were a British judicial decision handed down in 1939 and a new British abortion law enacted in 1967. Id., at 137138. The Court did not explain why these sources shed light on the meaning of the Constitution, and not one of them adopted or advocated anything like the scheme that Roe imposed on the country. Finally, after all this, the Court turned to precedent. Citing a broad array of cases, the Court found support for a right to privacy broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. Id., at 153154. The Court acknowledged that its conclusion was contrary to longstanding precedent holding that abortion is a criminal offense, but it explained that this precedent was erroneous and had been undermined by more recent decisions. Id., at 151152. In sum, the Court's opinion in Roe v. Wade was based on a survey of history that was largely irrelevant, on a misreading of precedent, and on an extensive review of contemporary medical and legal literature that did not support the Court's conclusions.  The U.S. Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision created a legal framework for abortion that has been widely criticized for its lack of a clear justification for the lines it drew between pre- and post-viability abortions. In particular, the Court's decision has been criticized for its reliance on mortality rates as the sole factor in determining whether a state can regulate first trimester abortions.  The Supreme Court has ruled that the States have a compelling interest in protecting potential life, but that this interest does not become compelling until viability. This arbitrary line has not found much support among philosophers and ethicists who have attempted to justify a right to abortion.  The author argues that the concept of viability is not a clear and universal moral guideline, as it depends on factors such as medical technology and facilities.  The Supreme Court's opinion in Roe v. Wade is widely criticized by academic commentators for its lack of reasoning and its imposition of a uniform viability rule that limits the freedom of states to regulate abortion.  The Court in Casey abandoned any reliance on a privacy right and instead grounded the abortion right entirely on the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause. The Court did not reaffirm Roes erroneous account of abortion history and made no real effort to remedy Roes much-criticized discussion of viability.  The workability of the "undue burden" test established in Casey v. Jackson Women's Health Organization is called into question. This test, which is used to determine the validity of abortion-related laws, has been criticized for being difficult to understand and apply consistently.

The U.S. Supreme Court's Roe v.

The Court in Casey abandoned any reliance on a privacy right and instead grounded the abortion right entirely on the Fourteenth Amendments Due Process Clause. The workability of the "undue burden" test established in Casey v. Jackson Women's Health Organization is called into question.
