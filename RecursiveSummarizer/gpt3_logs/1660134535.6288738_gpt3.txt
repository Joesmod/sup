The Secretary of Health and Human Services may negotiate with drug manufacturers to set a maximum fair price for selected drugs, and these agreements may be renewed. Information submitted by manufacturers is confidential and will only be used by the Secretary or the Comptroller General. If a manufacturer has an agreement with a covered entity under the 340B program, the manufacturer is not required to provide the maximum fair price to the covered entity if the ceiling price is lower than the maximum fair price.
