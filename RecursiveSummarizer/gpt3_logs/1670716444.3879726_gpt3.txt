PROMPT:

Write a concise summary of the following:


thank you all for listening to our concerns, even taking the time out to do that.  But at the same time, not just listening to offer some solution and help, because it is the black community that's suffering more than anybody else.  And if you, I don't have to tell you guys, you hear it every day, just like we do in every other race, all the killings that's going on.  Our youth don't, they don't respect us because we don't respect us.  The mayor's office and even some alderman don't respect us when we come and tell them these issues.  So in order to get past this, we're gonna have to collectively come together and offer some solutions.  And that's all I have to say.  And thank you for hearing our concerns.  Thank you, Mr.  Sullivan.  This concludes the public comment period.  The committee will now move to hear two items on today's agenda.  Number one is the approval of the September 2021 rule 45 report for the committee.  All committee should have, all members of the committee should have received the copy of this electronically.  If there any questions or comments, please use the raise your hand function for the item.  Can I get a motion to approve the rule 45 report by the same roll call as was applied to determine quorum? Move to pass.  Move to pass.  All of them in the spot of moves do pass here no objection, so ordered.  This will be reported out at the next city council meeting on Wednesday, February 23rd, 2022.  We will now address item number two.  Item number two is a subject matter hearing to discuss the job order contracting and the utilization numbers regarding minority owned business enterprises and women owned business enterprises.  This ordinance was introduced by Alderman Pat Dowell and myself.  We will have a couple of people giving testimony on the item.  We will have our department of procurement services commissioner Eileen Velesquez, as well as CDOT first deputy Tom Carney, AIS deputy Robin Owens, CHA senior director, Dan Cruz and CHA deputy
