The petitioner in this case is an artist who creates custom messages using words and graphics. The respondent, Colorado, has declared her speech a public accommodation and insists that she create and speak messages that violate her conscience. The Supreme Court is being asked to apply its precedent to this case. The conversation is about whether or not the case is ripe. Ms. Waggoner argues that it is ripe because the parties have stipulated every message that Ms. Smith would create has a unique, customized message and that it celebrates a wedding and celebrates a marriage. She also argues that Colorado has a history of aggressive enforcement against Ms. Smith, which has chilled her speech for six years. Amber creates websites for same-sex couples. If she decides she no longer wants to do this, she cannot be compelled to continue. The conversation is about whether a website designer can refuse to design a website for a same-sex couple on the basis of her religious beliefs. The Supreme Court has already recognized that there is a difference of opinion on the issue of marriage, and the designer is arguing that she should not be required to express a view that violates her conscience. Justice Kagan points out that the refusal is not based on the content of the speech, but on the fact that the couple is same-sex. The speaker is arguing that the content of the website is not the issue, it is the message that the website is sending by being used in a same-sex marriage. The conversation is about a wedding website designer who is being sued for refusing to create a website for a same-sex couple. The designer argues that she should not be forced to create speech that she disagrees with.

Ms. Wagganer responds that the Pulitzer Prize goes to the photographer, and that the reason is because they are requiring that artist to speak a message. The conversation then turns to a hypothetical about race and selling to someone of a different race. The conversation is about whether or not a web designer can refuse to take photos of black, Hispanic, and Asian children for a Christmas website.

However, the other justices point out that the message of the website is not clear, and that the web designer may be engaging in racial discrimination. The Court is discussing whether or not religious objections to same-sex marriage are the same as religious objections to people of color. The answer is no, according to Obergefell.

The Supreme Court is hearing a case about a wedding photographer who refused to serve a same-sex couple. The photographer argues that she should be allowed to refuse service based on her religious beliefs. The justices are questioning whether the Compelled Speech Doctrine applies in this case. The lawyer for the case argues that the speech could be compelled if the only indication of any limitation was a tag line at the end saying these services are for heterosexual couples only. The Chief Justice then asks what if the website said that it would not provide services for anything other than heterosexual marriages because of religious reasons. The lawyer responds that the religious basis is not determinative here and that the Compelled Speech Doctrine applies in a host of situations and cases that are not religious.

The Supreme Court is hearing a case about whether a Colorado law requiring designers of websites to sell their services to same-sex couples violates the designers' right to free speech.

The Supreme Court is hearing a case about a same-sex couple who was denied service from a wedding website company. The company is arguing that they should be allowed to deny service to same-sex couples because it violates their freedom of speech.

Therefore, the company should not be exempt from these laws.

The conversation is between two people discussing a law that states businesses cannot discriminate based on sexual orientation. The first person asks if a website designer who puts a message on their website that they do not serve same-sex couples is violating the law. The second person responds that the website designer is not violating the law because they are not turning away same-sex couples, they are just choosing what services to offer.

In Obergefell, the justices discuss whether a business can refuse to serve a customer based on race, sex, religion, or sexual orientation. Mr. Olson argues that there is no protected characteristic anywhere that would allow for this type of discrimination. The justices question whether this would fall under another statute, to which Mr. Olson replies that under any level of scrutiny, the state has a compelling interest in protecting against discrimination.

Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh are discussing a case involving a Colorado cake shop that refused to serve a same-sex couple.

However, the justices point out that the website designer is essentially engaging in compelled speech by forcing them to say something that they do not believe.

The conversation among the justices discuss the case of a Colorado baker who refused to make a cake for a same-sex couple's wedding.

The conversation is between two people discussing whether or not the law should exempt Ms. Smith, who has a status-based exemption, because her religious beliefs would be unmistakable to the public after viewing her website.

This is a conversation between Justice Kagan and Mr. Fletcher about whether businesses should be able to discriminate against customers based on the business owner's beliefs. They discuss a hypothetical case in which a woman is asked to say "God bless this union" as part of her job, and Justice Kagan says that she would come out one way if the woman was only asked to say the words, but she might come out the other way if the woman was being asked to do something else as part of her job.

The question is whether or not this hypothetical situation is the same as the case at hand, in which a speech-writing business is being required to apply a public accommodations law. Fletcher argues that the two situations are not the same, because in the hypothetical situation, the writer is being directly compelled to write something they disagree with, while in the case at hand, the speech-writing business is only being required to follow a content-neutral law.

The speaker in this case is arguing that the government should not be able to force people to say things against their will. They believe that this principle should apply to all forms of speech, including artistic expression.
