This individual is speaking in support of the budget amendment for the Chicago Social Justice Memorial. They discuss how the money is available and there is no reason for the seven year delay in fulfilling this promise to the survivors of police torture.

Mark Clements, a victim of police torture in 1981, is fighting for a memorial to be built for other victims of police torture. The memorial has been approved by the Chicago City Council, but has not been built yet. Clements is asking for the budget committee to do the right thing and build the memorial.

The city of Chicago has promised to build a memorial for the survivors of police torture, but has not followed through on this seven years later. Joey Mogul, a co-founder of Chicago torture justice memorials, is asking the City Council to approve funding for the memorial.

The city of Chicago has spent $37.5 million to defend officers and the city in the Burge torture cases, and $43 million in pensions to Burge and his detectives who were found to have committed acts of torture. Meanwhile, the city has only committed $50,000 for a planning grant for Chicago torture justice memorials. This is unconscionable and is unacceptable. Survivors of the torture are passing away, and the lack of funding for the memorial is continuing to traumatize them.

There is a problem with unplowed sidewalks in the city, which makes it difficult for people with limited mobility to get around. The current system of 311 reports is not working, and fines are not effective.

A Chicago resident is urging the city council to support a municipal sidewalk snow removal program, citing the dangers of not having clear sidewalks, especially for those who do not own cars. Toronto, a city with a similar population, has been clearing sidewalks for years.

Cheryl Nell Lane, a disabled resident of Chicago, urges the city council to fund a pilot program to clear sidewalks of snow and ice. She argues that this is necessary to ensure that all residents can safely get around, regardless of their ability level.

Claire Falk is a mother of three who lives in Logan Square. She is urging the City Council to fund the plowing of sidewalks, as it is a huge inconvenience for families who do not have cars and rely on walking or public transportation. Falk emphasizes that this is a major issue for families and vulnerable members of the community who cannot clear their own sidewalks.

Abla Garib, a motorized wheelchair user, and Nihal Dant-Lori, a resident of Lincoln Square, are calling on the City Council to set aside budget for a $750,000 pilot program to clear snow and ice from municipal sidewalks. They argue that this is necessary in order to ensure equity for all Chicagoans, as only two-thirds of residents use cars to get around, yet 100% of city streets are cleared.

The next speaker is Courtney Cobbs. Cobbs is a co-founder of Better Street Chicago, which aims to reduce car dependency in the city. One way to do this is to ensure that sidewalks are accessible for everyone in the winter. When the campaign began, they received emails from parents whose children had fallen due to someone not shoveling their sidewalk. City council approved $12.5 million for the Chicago MOOST program, but most of that went to oil and gas companies.

The speaker is in favor of the "plow the sidewalks" campaign, which would clear sidewalks of snow and ice in the winter. They argue that this is necessary for people who need to walk for their job or errands, as it can be dangerous to walk on icy sidewalks.

The speaker urges the city to support a pilot program to plow sidewalks, arguing that it is an issue that affects people of all ages, races, genders, and mobilities. The last speaker, Brittany King, talks about her experiences as a mother with a disability and how the lack of sidewalk plowing makes it difficult for her to get around. Mr. Blakemore is the last to speak and criticizes the city for not calling him to speak earlier.

The system is broken and this is a cesspool, according to the speaker. Mr. Blakemore must be somebody because he is still in the speaker's minutes, and the speaker is outraged that all the ultimate 16 of them have decided not to be ultimate. Somebody is cleaning up the cesspool, and the speaker thinks that maybe the council should have their meeting at 7pm instead of 10am so that the public can attend. This concludes the public comment period and the committee has received some written public comments.

Acting Commissioner for the Department of Assets, Information and Services Sandra Blakemore is asked to take a leadership role in finding places for migrants and the homeless to stay in Chicago before winter.

AIS is taking the lead on the issue of finding a new location for the Chicago Police Department's headquarters, working with a brokerage firm to identify potential facilities. Alderman Villegas is excited about the appointment of Acting Commissioner Blake Moore, and looks forward to working with him on utilizing technology to deliver city services more efficiently.

The city is investing in technology, and Alderman Coleman is excited to work with the new commissioner to implement upgrades. Alderman Solowski Garza asks about bundling office phone and printer services to get a better price, and the commissioner says she will look into it.

Alderman Burnett asks if Acting Commissioner Blake Moore is related to George Blake Moore. Acting Commissioner Moore says she can defer the question to her husband, who is present.

Alderman Hairston and Alderman Lopez are congratulating the new acting commissioner of the city departments. Alderman Lopez brings up the issue of ward-specific tax ID numbers, so that each ward can have its own budget and spending tracked, rather than being lumped together under one general number.

The city of Chicago is experiencing a turnover of 16 members of its office, and the new members will need to open their own public accounts. The comptroller's office is asked to streamline the process to make it easier for new and existing members. Additionally, the city is paying for renovations at various sites, and there is a concern about the quality of care given to individuals at these sites.

The ordinance introduced by Alderman Michelle Harris would transfer funds from within her committee on rules for the year 2022.

Alderman Harris is requesting a budget transfer from the committee of rules to the operating budget to cover supplies for upcoming meetings. Alderman Villegas is requesting a budget transfer from personal services to contractual services for court reporter services associated with mandatory SSA public hearings. Both motions are approved.

Alderman Villegas introduced a substitute ordinance concerning the transfer of funds within the Committee on Economic Capital and Technology Department Development for the year 2022. The ordinance transfers funds from personnel services to contingency, to be used for equipment and supplies. Alderman Riley moved to recommend approval, and the motion passed. The resolution introduced by Pat Dowell calls for the Illinois General Assembly to include provisions in future election-related legislation to make central vote centers permanent. Max Beaver from the Board of Elections and Michael George from the Legislative Reference Bureau gave testimony in support of the resolution.

The Chicago Board of Elections is in support of making the use of vote centers permanent for election day. This resolution would allow early voting sites to also be open on election day, providing a convenient option for voters who may not be able to make it to their assigned precinct polling place.

The city of Chicago is looking to make early voting sites permanent so that they can continue to be used as vote centers on election day. This is in response to voter suppression efforts happening across the country. Alderman Osterman is leading the charge on this issue and is hoping to get support from the state legislature by the end of the year.

The resolution presented will help to expand voting rights and make it easier for people to vote. It includes measures such as additional voting sites and early voting. This will help to alleviate some of the fears people have around voting and ensure that everyone's voice is heard.

The Chicago Board of Elections is concerned about voter confusion and is taking steps to ensure that people are aware of where their polling place is and what ward they are in. They are also increasing staffing on election day.

The Chicago Board of Elections is preparing for a busy election day by consolidating precincts and overstaffing polling places. They are also providing additional resources at their headquarters for people who may have difficulty finding their correct polling place or who prefer to vote at a vote center.

The resolution before the committee is to consolidate precincts in order to help with the election process on election day. This will help with the confusion on election day and make it easier for people to find their polling place. The next step is to work with the Board of Election to make sure this gets before the governor.

The Chicago City Council is considering a change to the way voting works in the city, which would allow people to vote at any precinct polling place. They are also considering an amendment to the annual appropriation ordinance for the mayor's office for people with disabilities.

The Department of Housing is requesting to accept additional federal grant funds in the amount of 8 million 345,000 from the US Department of Treasury for the emergency rental housing assistance program. The funds will be used to provide rental assistance payments to tenants and landlords under the federal emergency rental assistance program, and in particular court based programs. The Department of Public Health is requesting to accept additional federal grant funds in the amount of 644,000 from the US Department of Health and Human Services for the building epidemiology and health it capacity program, also known as epidemiology and laboratory capacity for infectious disease program.

The Department of Public Health in Chicago is requesting additional state and federal grant funding to support various health initiatives, including covert 19 testing, monitoring of variants, and inspections of body art and tanning facilities. The HIV behavioral surveillance program will also be expanded to include more high-risk populations. Finally, the lead hazard reduction program will aim to protect more children under the age of six from lead poisoning.

The Department of Public Health is requesting additional state grant funds to screen clients for HIV risk and connect them with access to medication and disease prevention services. The mayor's office is requesting additional federal grant funds to focus on sexual violence experienced by people with disabilities. The Department of Family Support Services is requesting additional public grant funds to support coordinated services for additional outreach services by the Chicago Transit Authority.

The City of Chicago has allocated $36 million to support unsheltered residents who are utilizing trains and other CTA spaces for shelter. Services are limited to the blue and red lines. Haymarket will provide services for the blue line and thresholds will provide services for the red line.

The MPV response can be tied into other responses, such as the COVID vaccine response. No dedicated MPV funding has been received from the federal government, but this may change in the future.

The city of Chicago is set to receive a large new allocation of HUD money, which will be used to remediate lead and other hazards from at least 335 homes by 2026.

The city of Chicago is proposing a series of corrections and revisions to the 2023 budget recommendations, including the creation of a new Office of Climate and Environmental Equity and the amendment of the city's AARP grant funds.

The city is considering creating a new Office of Climate and Environmental Equity, which would study the feasibility of creating a Department of Environment. Some council members believe that a separate office is needed to manage this issue, while others feel that a department can be created without further study.

The city is adding additional positions to its management ordinance, and is commissioning a study to look at where all the new roles will go. Hopefully, by 2024 the city will have a robust department in place.

The alderman is in favor of the Office of Climate and Environmental Equity, but would like to see it become a full department eventually. They believe that removing the Department of Environment back in 2011 was not the best move, and that bringing these responsibilities back together under one office will be more effective.

The city is looking at ways to improve enforcement of sanitation laws, including potentially moving enforcement back to the Department of Public Health. They are also looking at the role of the Department of Environment and streets and sanitation in relation to garbage collection.

The Office of Climate and Environmental Equity is intended to work across sectors and departments to advance the vision set forth in the city's climate action plan. The office will serve as a coordinating body to lower greenhouse gas emissions and drive equitable benefits for communities.

The city of Chicago is planning to create a new Department of Environment, and they are committed to engaging the alderman in the process.

The question is whether the budget for the upcoming year includes a salary increase. The answer is that it does not, and that the budget director thinks this is disingenuous. There is a central piece of the budget that has not been addressed, which is the re-implementation of the Department of Environment. This was promised four years ago, but has not been done.

The budget for the City of Chicago includes funding for a new Department of the Environment, but does not include funding for the Chicago torture justice memorial. mental health clinics that have been shuttered is good governance. We were promised transparency and accountability, and I don't see how this budget delivers on that promise.

The city of Chicago is spending $8.9 million per year on ShotSpotter technology, which has not been independently verified. Studies from the city's inspector general, the MacArthur Justice Center at Northwestern University, and Johns Hopkins University have all cast serious doubts on the effectiveness of ShotSpotter. As a result, many cities have canceled their contracts with ShotSpotter, and police departments have refused to renew their contracts. The technology is not working and is actually harming Chicago. Alderman Ramirez Rosa is disappointed that the city is still using ShotSpotter and that mental health clinics have not been reopened as promised. He says the budget fails in this regard.

The city is looking to study how best to reorganize its departments to better protect the environment. This will include looking at how other similar departments are structured and run in other cities, as well as engaging stakeholders in the process. The goal is to come up with a plan for the best possible governance structure for the city. The study will be conducted by CCA (pro bono) and should take about six months.

The question is about the accountability to get a study done in six months, and the answer is that the language in the contract will require that the study be completed and brought back to the committees for review. There is also a date in the contract to keep everyone accountable to make sure that the study is completed on time.

The city is adding a director to the Office of Community Engagement in the mayor's office, which will serve as the director of veteran affairs. This is in addition to the other five positions that were already included into the budget. The positions that are in the Office of Policy have been moved to the Office of Climate and Environmental Equity.

Alderman Austin is proposing a budget amendment to reinstate the Chicago Office of Veteran Affairs. The position would be titled as the director of Chicago Veteran Affairs and would be given a budget of 400,000 dollars. Alderman Austin has the support of 35 co-sponsors and is hoping to gain the support of the 14 remaining aldermen.

The alderman points out that the budget includes an increase in funding for rapid rehousing and homeless outreach, as well as a new position for a community liaison in the Commission on Public Safety Police Accountability. They express curiosity as to why there is resistance to creating a full Department of Environment, given that it has broad support from various caucuses.

The council is discussing the budget for the upcoming year and how to best allocate funds. They mention the Department of Housing and how it was created four years ago without much thought or planning. The Department of Environment has done well in recent years, but the council wonders why they haven't been given more attention or resources. Thank you, Madam Chair.

The City of Chicago does not have a specific office or department dedicated to gun violence prevention, but violence prevention is a priority for all city departments. Funding for violence prevention efforts comes from the public health department, and coordination is handled by the CSCC.

The City of Chicago has allocated $100 million for gun violence prevention, but has only spent $5 million to date. They are reallocating the unspent funds to be used over the next two years. Additionally, they are expanding their care program with an additional $15 million going into 2023.

The city is allocating $15 million over the next few years to expand its pilot program for responding to mental health crises. This will include adding new teams and shifts, as well as expanding geographically.

The fourth team on the west side will focus on substance use and will include a community paramedic and recovery specialist. The team is already in the works and being planned. Additionally, second shifts will be added in the near future. The data has been pulled to identify the parts of the city where the needs are greatest and additional teams will be added in those areas.

The budget director does not have any additional programming for police retention in the amendments, but is working on making improvements to the police department as a whole.

The superintendent spoke about a mentor program for police officers. He said that the department is losing officers every day, and that they need to do more to incentivize retention. He also said that part of the work the department is doing around the capital plan is to improve facilities and vehicles to help with retention.

Aldermanic complaints about the lack of progress on creating an environmental office are based on a lack of understanding of the bureaucratic process and a lack of patience.

The Office of the Environment is a new department created to focus on climate and environmental equity. It is led by a chief sustainability officer and a deputy commissioner, and has ten employees in total. Six of these are project managers, and the other four are grant researchers, specialists, and an administrative assistant. This department was created in response to feedback that there was a need for more interagency coordination around sustainability.

The city council is discussing the formation of a new department, the Office of the Environment. This office will be responsible for internal and external engagement, and will be overseen by a sustainability officer. The council is still discussing the budget for this office, but the goal is to have a full department in place by 2024.

The city council will vote on the budget and if it passes, the chief will be appointed. If Alderman Cardness could maybe organize the contest of renaming the committee that doesn't exist before he walks out the door.

The question is whether or not a pro bono study is sufficient to plan for the new Department of Environment in Chicago. The concern is that without proper funding, the department will not be able to adequately regulate against environmental injustices.

The Department of Environment is conducting a study to evaluate the feasibility of sustainable revenue sources to maintain the department in the long term. The study will also explore the functions of the department and identify gaps and services.

The question has to do with funding for the police department and ensuring that there are enough officers to meet the needs of the city. The commissioner noted that they are looking into ways to be more efficient with their budget and make sure that the money is being spent in the most effective way possible.

The question is about the plan to improve public facilities and whether there is a vision for this from the administration. There is funding for improvements to public facilities in the capital plan, and agencies are working on coordination to address issues like youth mental health.

The city is committed to upgrading and maintaining its mental health facilities, and has more than doubled access to mental health services in the past year. By the end of 2020, every community in Chicago will have a high-quality mental health clinic. In addition to this, the city has also built outreach programs to help those who are not stable enough to attend appointments.

The council has given funding and support to grow a safety net system for mental health in Chicago. This will include a site in every one of the 77 communities by the end of the year. The office of the environment is working on ways to improve the planet. One way is by having a pilot or study to help speed up the process.

Since I was appointed two years ago, we have fostered relationships with departments and leaders across the city. We have released a 2022 climate action plan, allocated unprecedented funding for climate and environmental justice priorities, and are working on the Chicago way strategy to identify materials for diversion from the waste stream. We have also opened up a citywide compost network and are close to planting 75,000 trees over the next five years.

The Department of Environment is expanding its capacity and working towards a more permanent structure. It is also working with other departments to improve the city's renewable energy contract and deliver 100% renewable energy by 2025.

Alderman Martin proposed a resolution in 2020 stating that the community was experiencing a climate crisis, and in January 2021 requested a study looking into what a department of the environment would look like. Two years later, 188 million has been invested into environmental assistance and sustainability, and a decarbonization plan has been put into action. However, Alderman Martin believes that there should be an actual department created to handle these issues, rather than just an office, and suggests that a vote be taken to make this change.

The City Council has voted to pass two ordinances concerning the expenditure of state motor fuel tax funds. The first ordinance allocates funds to the city for the period of January 1st 2023 to December 31st 2023. The second ordinance allocates funds to the Chicago Transit Authority as a year 2023 matching grant.

The city of Chicago and Cook County are required to provide five million dollars annually to the CTA in order to receive RTA funds. The city provides three million of the five million annual requirement while Cook County provides the two million. This is an annual allocation provided by the city.

The City Council has voted to approve a substitute ordinance amending various provisions of the municipal code regarding the organization and functions of city government. The ordinance, known as the 2023 management ordinance, will take effect at the next City Council meeting.

This ordinance establishes the new Office of Climate and Environmental Equity and requires that a study be commissioned to provide recommendations by June 30th, 2023 regarding the establishment of a department responsible for environmental policymaking and operations. It also gives diverse the same meaning as minority in sections two dash 92 dash 670 n in order to expand the definition to include the people indigenous to the Americas.

The ordinance makes a number of changes to the city's code, including increasing the salaries of the city clerk and city treasurer, exempting volunteers from indebtedness requirements, and removing obsolete language from sections of the code. It also clarifies the ability of the office of labor standards to enforce worker protection laws and establishes an administrative process for transfer of ownership of properties currently receiving out of city water service.

The Chicago City Council is considering a number of amendments to the city's code of ordinances, including one that would eliminate the platform license for airlines. Other proposed amendments include changes to the roles of the scheduling manager and ramp manager under the Chicago airline terminal consortium agreement, and a requirement that the city be guided by the seven principles outlined by the U.S. interagency council on homelessness to address homelessness in Chicago.

The Department of Law is proposing a change to the way lobbyists are regulated. Currently, lobbyists are required to register with the city and cooperate with the inspector general. The proposed change would add a clause to the registration agreement requiring lobbyists to cooperate with the city's superintendent or chief administrator.

The mayor is responsible for selecting a candidate or candidates for reappointment to the commission, and must provide a written explanation if they reject a reappointment candidate. "Diverse" has the same meaning as "minority", including all people from the Americas who were historically excluded.

The city is trying to modernize its hiring process by getting rid of the affidavit and doing the debt check application instead. This is to make it easier for people to apply for jobs with the city.

The office of labor standards is responsible for ensuring that workers in the city of Chicago are treated fairly. The difference between an employee and a worker is that an employee is someone who receives all full benefits, while a worker may be an independent contractor.

The proposed ordinance would require companies offering short-term rentals to obtain a license and pay a fee. The fee would be $250 for the company, plus $60 for each host.

The city of Chicago is proposing a new law that would require people who rent out their properties on platforms like Airbnb to pay a license fee of $250, plus a $60 fee for each unit they rent out. This would apply to people who rent out single units, like apartments or houses. The purpose of the fees is to generate revenue for the city and to crack down on illegal rental activity.

The individual owner of a rental unit would not have to pay the 125 registration fee if they are not affiliated with a platform. This is only for platforms that are reporting to the city of Chicago.

The city council is considering making the emergency procurement authority of the chief procurement officer (CPO) permanent, removing the sunset provision. The rationale for this is that costs have increased significantly in recent years and the CPO needs the flexibility to respond quickly to emergencies.

The city is looking to make a permanent change to the emergency procurement threshold, which would take power away from the city council and give it to the cpo. This would affect transactions that range between 500,000 and a million dollars. The city is also looking to make changes to the short-term rental licensing, which would lower the thresholds for platforms that list fewer units.

Alderman Riley asks for a list of smart platforms that the city is using, noting that he is only familiar with four or five of them. Alderman She points out that the elected officials have a responsibility to be stewards of taxpayer money. Alderman Viegas requests that in the future, each council member be assigned to a department so that they can be more involved in the budget process.

The budget for the city of Chicago includes a management ordinance that allows for the salaries of the city clerk and city treasurer to be adjusted according to the CPI starting in 2024. The mayor's salary will not be adjusted until 2023.

The aldermen are discussing the mayor's salary, which has not been increased since 2024. They are considering an adjustment to the CPI (Consumer Price Index) which would increase the mayor's salary. However, Alderman Tony is opposed to this idea. The board takes a five minute break to discuss the matter further.
