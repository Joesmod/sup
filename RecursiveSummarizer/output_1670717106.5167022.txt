The district committee is meeting today to discuss the sale of a vacant city-owned property. The property is located at 429 East 48th Street.

The city is selling a vacant lot to Jeffrey and Stephanie Glover Douglas for $4,500. The lot is 16.66 by 124.75 and is zoned for residential use. It is adjacent to their property at 427 East 48th place. The sale has the support of Alderman Pat Dowell.

The city is selling a vacant lot to Nagaya T. Burner for $1,000. The lot is zoned for Rt4 use and is 3125 square feet. The sale has the support of Alderman Jason Irvin.

The City of Chicago is selling a vacant lot at 415 South Kilborne Avenue to Carisha Watts for $1,000. The lot is 26.83 times 109, 2,925 square feet approximately. This sale has support from 28th Ward Alderman Jason C. Irvin and the parcel has AAS clearance.

The city is selling a former library at 6435 North California. The original offers for the property were below the appraised value, but after a round of highest and best offers, the city received an offer that was well above the appraised value. This is a big win for the city, as it helps to fill the budget gap from last year.

The City of Chicago is proposing to sell a vacant lot to Forging Opportunities for Refugees in America (FORA), an organization that provides services to refugees in the Chicago area. The sale would be a big win for FORA, as they are already located in the neighborhood and work with other local organizations. The amendment to the escrow agreement would allow FORA to excavate and dispose of contaminated woodchips on the property. Alderman Deborah Silverstein is in support of the sale and amendment, as FORA does excellent work in helping refugees navigate the language and cultural differences in the United States. There are no objections from members of the committee, and the sale is recommended for approval at the next City Council meeting.

The North Austin Community Center is being redeveloped into a community and athletic center. The project is already under construction and is scheduled to be completed in November. The developer has requested that contaminated wood chips be included as eligible expenses for the project, and the DPD has approved this request. The ordinance is being amended to add language allowing these wood chips to be counted towards the escrow drawdown.

The ordinance in question cannot be moved forward at this time, but the chairman of the committee has offered to recess the committee so that Alderman Metz and Graham Crady can discuss it with the law department.

The purpose of the ordinance is to allow the Department of Public Health to execute a long-term agreement with ComEd for access to a former industrial property on the southeast side of Chicago. The property is bordered by railroad tracks, Carondale Avenue, east 130th street, and east 126th place. The site was used to store and dump slag material from the former Republic LTV steel manufacturing operations, and trespassers have been utilizing the site.

The US EPA has added a site to the Superfund national priorities list which will allow the US EPA to clean up the contaminated site. The goal is to construct a barrier and fence along the access areas. The city will arrange for installation of the barrier system along the south end of the shroud site.
