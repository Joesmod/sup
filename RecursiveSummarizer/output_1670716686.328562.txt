The Department of Procurement Services is seeking approval to extend the city's MBE WPE program for construction, which is scheduled to sunset at the end of this month. The program is designed to ensure that all firms have an opportunity to participate in contracts that are paid for with taxpayer dollars.

The city of Chicago is committed to improving conditions for minority and women owned businesses, and has engaged a leading national expert to conduct a disparity study and make recommendations. The resulting recommendations include continuing and revising the eligibility requirements for the CSM w program for construction. There is strong support from organizations representing over 1800 diverse businesses for this ordinance.

The ordinance being discussed extends the current program, which is set to expire on September 30. It also raises the size cap on the gross receipts of an individual firm to 150% of the US Small Business Administration size standards. The purpose of the ordinance is to continue to support minority and women owned businesses in the city.

The three major changes to the Chicago ordinance regulating surety companies are (1) an increase in the number of assets that are exempt from the calculation of the personal net worth limit; (2) a change in the way liquidity is calculated, and (3) the removal of the requirement that the majority of an applicant's full time workforce be located in the city marketplace.

The proposed ordinance would extend the current IMBEWBE program and make changes to how the program is run. The biggest change is that businesses would have to be located in and have their principal place of business in the city marketplace in order to participate. This would benefit the city of Chicago by making the program more equitable for all participants.

The Shelby County, Tennessee MWBE program was challenged in court, and the county decided to settle the case and end the program.

The speaker discusses the challenges faced by the federal government in addressing systemic racism. They mention a lawsuit filed by white farmers against a program designed to help black and other minority farmers. The speaker expresses concern about the hostility of the federal courts to these types of programs and the lack of progress in addressing systemic racism.

The council is discussing an ordinance that will strengthen programs for minority and women-owned businesses. Councilor Holt believes that the ordinance will help these businesses compete for prime contracts and hire more minority and women employees. There are some questions about the details of the ordinance, but overall it is received positively by the council.

The county has an ordinance in place that requires a certain percentage of contractors to be minority-owned businesses. This ordinance is being challenged by a group of white contractors. The city uses a master directory of minority-owned businesses to determine which contractors qualify under the ordinance.

This study provides an analysis of the availability of minority- and women-owned businesses in the city, as well as the utilization of those businesses by the city over a five-year period. The study found that while the number of minority- and women-owned businesses has increased, the city has not been utilizing them to their full potential.

This person discusses the methodology used in the most recent disparity study, which was more comprehensive than the one used in the previous study. They note that the decline in African American utilization could not be accurately compared to the previous study.

The study found that African Americans were disproportionately affected by the lack of available jobs, and that this was likely due to discrimination.

The workforce restriction on certified firms requires that the majority of an applicant's full-time workforce must be located in the six county region. This is a burden that is placed on minority owned firms that non minority firms do not have to worry about.

The city should remove the requirement that employees of certified MBE firms must reside in the city, as this imposes an unnecessary burden on these businesses. However, the city should continue to encourage firms to domicile themselves in the city in order to take advantage of the economic benefits that come with it.

The presenter suggests that increasing the number of minority-owned businesses would force firms to consider them more for work opportunities. He argues that this would lead to more work for minority-owned businesses, based on his experience in the industry.

The report recommends several ways to increase the ability of small and medium businesses to act as prime contractors, including prompt payment, unbundling contracts, and increasing access to financing.

The council is discussing ways to increase access and opportunity for prime contracts, with a focus on smaller firms. Suggested next steps include working with the mayor's office to implement some of the proposed changes.

The city is working on a number of initiatives to improve the procurement process, including increasing communication with user departments, unbundling contracts, and making payments to contractors more quickly.

The city is looking to make changes to its procurement process, specifically with regard to certification and compliance. They have already started making some changes, such as eliminating the requirement for firms to be recertified every five years.

The city's Affirmative Procurement Program (APP) is in need of more resources in order to effectively help minority and women-owned businesses succeed. APP is currently thinly staffed, and this is hindering its ability to process certification applications and payments, as well as comply with regulations. Outreach efforts are also being hindered. Additional staff is needed in order to execute the program's goals and help businesses thrive.

The city of Chicago is currently sued by the Builders Association, and as a result, has two programs in place - the construction ordinance and the non construction ordinance. If a firm is certified under the construction ordinance, then the changes proposed in this ordinance apply to them. If a firm is certified outside the construction ordinance, then the changes don't apply to them.

The main issue is getting enough people and resources to ease the burden on city staff and to be able to speed up the processes and to do more. A separate department could help to bring more resources.

The city is discussing its org chart and whether or not to add another category for construction and non-construction. It is decided that there is no need for another category, as it would add bureaucratic complexity without much clarity.

Alderman Taylor asks for the numbers of NBA and WV contracts and businesses in the last five years, and the chairman says they can be provided. There is a motion to pass the ordinance, and it is approved by the same vote that determined quorum.

The city council will vote on an ordinance that would extend a program giving veteran-owned small businesses increased opportunities to participate in city contracts. If passed, the program would be extended through 2023.

The committee on contracting oversight and equity is extending a pilot program that provides incentives for city contractors to hire returning citizens. The director of procurement will provide updates on other similar programs that have been discussed in the past.

The equity is adjourned. Thank you all for your time and effort.
