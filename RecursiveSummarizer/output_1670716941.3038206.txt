The committee on contract and oversight and equity is meeting by video conference due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. No vote will be taken at this meeting. One public speaker is allowed to speak.

The CME supports Mayor Lightfoot's ordinance to continue the MWBE construction program. The MWBE construction program has afforded women and minority-owned construction companies the ability to work on public construction projects. However, those lucrative private construction projects in Chicago continue to elude us. WCOE urges the city to address this disparity and provide additional opportunities for women and minority contractors.

The city of Chicago is looking to increase opportunities for women and women of color in the construction industry. The goal is to raise the percentage of women-owned businesses (WBE) to 10%, with 2% of that being reserved for women of color (WOC). This would increase economic opportunities for all women and minority contractors.

The City of Chicago is extending its MBE program in construction, which is set to expire this September. Collette Holt, a leading national expert, has been hired to conduct a disparity study to assess the local marketplace and provide recommendations. The study is based on data analysis and feedback from Chicago businesses and assist agencies. The findings and recommendations identify several strategies for improving conditions for minority and women-owned businesses. Letters of support have been received from assist agencies representing over 1800 small businesses. The goal is to develop policies that create more opportunities for local diverse firms to experience meaningful and sustainable growth in industries beyond what has been traditionally seen.

The speaker discusses the legal standards for race and gender-conscious contracting programs, which are subject to strict constitutional scrutiny. The government must prove a compelling interest in using race or gender through strong evidence of past discrimination and current effects of past discrimination or current race and gender-based barriers. The program must also be narrowly tailored to meet this interest.

The federal courts have struck down many programs across the country that seek to provide assistance and loan forgiveness to disadvantaged groups, including Black and Indigenous farmers and minority-owned businesses. These decisions are based on the lack of evidence of discrimination by the government.

The objective of the research project was to meet federal constitutional requirements, provide the city with updated data, get input from various constituencies, and develop program recommendations. The study found that there are many barriers minority and women construction firms still face.

The study found that minorities and women in the construction industry in the Chicago area continue to face biases, stereotypical attitudes, negative assumptions about their competencies, and all of the implicit and explicit biases that hinder their ability to grow and to thrive. Industry networks are still difficult to penetrate for people to find out about work, and business owners told the researchers that it was difficult to get work outside of the city and other government affirmative action programs. Racial harassment and conflict still occur, as well as hostile work environments and sexist behaviors and outright harassment of women. Prime contracts are particularly difficult to obtain.

The study found that women and minority-owned businesses are formed at a lower rate, earn less, and continue to experience disparities compared to similar white-owned businesses. The study used census data to come up with an expected availability of MWBEs, taking into account the current headcount of who is available in the Chicago market and a rubric from the census. The study found that the expected availability for MBEs is lower than what is currently available, indicating that some discriminatory forces are still at play.

The study found that the city's construction program has been effective in increasing opportunities for minority- and women-owned businesses (MWBEs). However, MWBEs still receive a disproportionately low share of prime contracts and dollars compared to non-MWBEs. There is consensus that the program needs more resources to improve coordination and monitoring, and that the speed of pay applications and change orders needs to be improved.

The current limits on the gross receipts of the firm and the personal net worth of the individual applicant owner restrict the growth of MWBEs in this market. The federal courts absolutely require that there be limits to the size of firms in your program and the personal net worth of the owners of those firms. The city's old program did not include a personal net worth test, leading to the current ordinance. Bonding and access to working capital are necessary to assist MWBEs to take on larger work and more complex projects. The utilization has exceeded availability and those goals for all groups. The goals seem to be targets that work and that we can meet and that the courts are likely to uphold.

The report recommends that the city remove the restriction on only certified MWV's ( Minority and Women-Owned Businesses) that their full time workforce must be in the six county region. It also suggests that the city address delays in initial certification application processing and recertification application processing.

The city of New York has a number of programs and initiatives in place to support Minority- and Women-owned Businesses (MWBEs), but there are still some areas that could be improved. One suggestion is to focus on MWBE Prime Awards, and to use some various techniques to do that, one of which is to try to unfundle or make contracts smaller or less complex. Another suggestion is to implement a technical assistance and capital access bonding program.

The study found that many firms were confused about the quota or set-aside program for M.W.B.E. (Minority and Women-Owned Businesses), and that there was insufficient monitoring of contractual compliance. It was suggested that educational efforts be made to improve understanding of the program, and that resources be beefed up to better monitor compliance. It was also suggested that a new department be created to administer the program, and that a construction working group be formed to meet regularly to discuss changes to the program.

The goal is to increase the availability and capacity of M.W.B.E.s to take on city projects, larger projects, more complex projects, more varied projects and more work as primes. To do this, the recommendations are to take 150% of the gross receipts level that is established by the SBA, and to increase the amount of money available for the M.W.B.E. program by $1 million.

The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes are used to classify businesses by size. The current size standards for businesses in the Chicago area are too low, and the time period over which they are averaged should be lengthened from five years to seven years.

The SBA is targeting 150% of its goals, and the protege program is not producing the desired results.

The individual is concerned that the application process for the MBWB is unfair, as it requires black and brown contractors to jump through extra hoops (e.g. paying a fee, having sections of their firm dedicated to compliance) that white contractors do not.

The city of Detroit is facing a problem with its construction industry ordinances, which are set to expire at the end of September. The city has two pieces to its program, one focused on construction and one on equity. The equity piece is lagging behind, and the city is not doing enough to support black and brown contractors who are successful in the program.

The city is considering paying minority contractors more promptly in order to incentivize them to become prime contractors on larger projects. One suggestion is to pay them 150% of what is owed, rather than the current 200%.

The city of Chicago is currently meeting or exceeding its goals for minority contracting, but the federal courts are concerned that these goals may be too ambitious. The city should therefore focus on improving implementation rather than setting higher goals.

The study found that, with the exception of Native Americans, all subcategories of minority groups had utilization rates that exceeded availability. The study recommends focusing on making sure that the program is running well, rather than changing the ordinance, to avoid unintended consequences. When it comes to LGBTQ businesses, the study recommends reaching out to all relevant groups to ensure that they are included.

The data sources for LGBT individuals are very limited, and it is difficult to define which groups to include. The legal standard for sexual orientation and gender presentation is also unclear. The chamber certifications for the national LGBTQ chamber may be a potential data source.

The city is looking to include LGBT chambers in their outreach efforts, but it is complicated because there is not a lot of reliable data on sexual orientation and gender identity. The city has worked with the Illinois LGBT chamber in the past, but it is difficult to get accurate information on chamber members.

This person is discussing the difficulty of implementing anti-discrimination measures for the LGBTQ+ community, in light of the fact that sexual orientation and gender presentation are not currently protected under law. They note that while there is a clear problem, it is difficult to know how to address it without clear guidance from the Supreme Court. One suggestion they have is to encourage LGBTQ+ people who are also members of other marginalized groups to participate in existing anti-discrimination programs.

The federal DBE approach allows people to come in on an individual basis and demonstrate that they are suffering discriminatory barriers. If they can do this, the program will certify them. This is another possible approach that may be more effective than the current system.

The speaker is discussing the legal requirements for minority and women hiring, and how these requirements differ from the general population. They explain that what the courts care about is the availability of businesses to do the type of work the city purchases, and that this number is much lower than the population percentage. They suggest using data from a study to set goals on a contract-by-contract basis, taking into account the expected availability of businesses if discriminatory barriers were lessened.

The speaker suggests that the city should not make changes to the current ordinance goals, as they are working well and could potentially put the program at risk if changed. They also highlight the importance of having goals in place in order to maintain participation.

There is a need to change the way contracting works in the city in order to encourage minority and women-owned businesses to thrive. Recommendations include increasing transparency and access to information, streamlining the payment process, and increasing access to bonding and financing programs.

The job of the procurement department is not to advocate for a contractor, but to help them grow and compete. There are many things that can be done to improve the situation, and the department should take a temperature check in 12-24 months to see if improvements have been made. One suggestion is to put provisions in place for bonding and federal contracts that encourage hiring locally.

The private sector always has to operate within the terms of the grant or whatever the funding sources. The first thing is to figure out what are the restrictions on the source of the funds and what agency are getting them? But then again, I think as I'm looking down the road towards hopefully the infrastructure money coming is to get firms ready, because these projects are gonna come, they're gonna come fast and they're gonna come big and they're gonna be complex. And so these types of technical support initiatives that we've recommended, I think are really important, making sure people learn about the opportunities, that there's outreach, that there's access to the information, and that we do everything we can to try to get these firms in a position so that they can participate in these projects.

The Missouri Department of Transportation had a supportive services program with reduced fees for construction lawyers and accountants. This is the type of support people need. If we get going now, we'll be in a better position to help these people to take advantage of the probably deluge of opportunities.

The idea being discussed is that MBE and WB entities would be able to do more work if their gross receipts were counted towards the total amount of the contract, rather than just the work they do themselves. The concern is that this would be too complicated to keep track of and might be seen as preferential treatment for minority-owned businesses. It is also noted that a similar change would have to be made for engineers and architects, but that a study would need to be done first to see if there is a need for it.

The Committee on Contract and Oversight Equity adjourned after hearing from Artemie Vegas and Collette Hope. There being no further questions or comments, the committee members voted to adjourn. Thank you all was the final statement.
