The committee on contracting oversight and equity is meeting by video conference due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They will vote on labor items. There is one person present for public comment. The agenda includes two substitutions for items two and three in ordinance and a resolution.

The proposed ordinance would add hate crimes to the list of offenses that would make a person ineligible to do business with the city of Chicago.

The city of Chicago has amended its municipal code to include hate crimes as well as treason and sedition as grounds for businesses to be ineligible for city contracts. This is in addition to the original ordinance which included these offenses as well as related offenses.

The proposed ordinance would restrict businesses and individuals from doing business with the city if they have been convicted of hate crimes, treason, sedition, or related offenses.

This is an ordinance that would prevent businesses and individuals convicted of sedition from doing business with the City of Chicago. It is in response to the insurrection at the US Capitol building on January 6, 2021.

The substitute ordinance will be reported out at the next city council meeting on Wednesday, March 23, 2022. It calls for the Chicago municipal code section 2-9 2-4 2-0 to include Middle Eastern or North African Americans as a minority group.

Arab Americans in Chicago have long been disadvantaged in terms of economic opportunities and treatment, due to persistent discrimination. This has been documented by various studies and reports over the years. Arab Americans continue to be concentrated in small businesses, and face challenges in moving up the occupational ladder due to stereotypes and prejudice.

The study compared Arab Americans and non Latinx whites in the Chicago metropolitan area and found that Arab Americans with bachelor's degrees or higher do not generate incomes commensurate with their education. Arab Americans were paid 13% less than similarly situated non Latinx whites. The wage gap between non Latinx whites and Arab Americans has more than doubled in the last decade. The largest decline of any ethnic racial group in metropolitan Chicago. Arab Americans in Chicago metropolitan area are 23% more likely to live in poverty and 11.5% more likely to lack health insurance.

The Arab American community is asking the city council to take steps to study discrimination against Arab Americans and to sponsor a bill to include Arab Americans as a minority group for the city's construction MBE minority business enterprise program.

The exclusion of Middle Eastern or North African Americans from the US Census Bureau has led to the inability for them to obtain many resources provided to other historically disadvantaged groups. This substitute resolution calls on the city Chicago to conduct a study regarding the inclusion of Middle Eastern Americans as a minority group for the purpose of the city's construction and be program. Such a study will help build the support needed to address the reality discrimination felt by the community.

The committee on contracting oversight and equity is hereby ordered by John, the chairman. Thank you to all colleagues for their great work. Have a great day!
