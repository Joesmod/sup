The Chicago Social Justice Memorial is a proposed budget amendment that would allocate funds to create a memorial honoring social justice activists in the city. The amendment has been sent to the budget committee for consideration.

We are asking for $2.25 million to build a memorial for survivors of police torture. We've already raised $500,000, but we haven't been able to get the memorial built yet. This is because the city, county, and state have all been complicit in the torture.

Mark Clements, a victim of police torture in 1981, is requesting that the Chicago City Council build a memorial for victims of police torture. He notes that the city has already approved the memorial, but it has yet to be built.

The city of Chicago is set to create a new office with various responsibilities for sustainability in the coming year. The budget for this office includes 10 positions, including a chief sustainability officer, grants research specialists, and project managers. There is also an additional division for veteran affairs and four new positions added to the homeless services division within the Department of Family Support Services.

The city is considering creating a new Office of Climate and Environmental Equity, which would study whether a separate Department of Environment is needed. This is a response to calls from many people who believe that the city needs a robust Department of Environment.

The city is considering creating a new pollution control department, and the budget for the department will start at zero. This is a small step towards a larger department that is needed, according to the speaker.

The city is looking to create a labor pool for temporary workers, with the aim of having the pool in place by April. The budget for the pool is 26,000 hours. The Office of Climate and Environmental Equity is being created as a step towards a full department, with enforcement authority currently residing with the Department of Public Health, Health and Buildings.

The City Council is discussing the possibility of creating a Department of Environment, which would be responsible for overall sanitation collection. They are looking at the costs of moving to a word-based system versus the current system.

The Office of Climate and Environmental Equity is a new office that will be responsible for coordinating the city's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and advance environmental and sustainability priorities. The office will be headed by the chief sustainability officer, who will work with all city departments to achieve these goals.

The idea of strategically planning includes engaging the alderman in many processes, including the release of reports on decarbonization. There is also a commitment to moving the budgeting process for the new department before the City Council. The current salary for the position is a bump from the previous rate.

The mayor's office budget is equal. However, the administration talked about re implementing a department environment. This would be a huge help to the city, and yet nothing has been done after four years.

This budget includes funding for the Chicago torture justice memorial and ShotSpotter technology. It does not reopen any shuttered mental health clinics. Some people have raised concerns about the effectiveness of ShotSpotter technology.

The aldermen are disappointed with the budget, specifically with the lack of funding for mental health services and the continued use of ShotSpotter. They are proposing a study to look into the feasibility of a Department of Environment.

The City of Austin is looking to study how to best combine different enforcement roles and responsibilities across the city, with the goal of creating a more efficient and effective governance structure. The study will be conducted with input from stakeholders and city leadership, and will be funded through pro bono consulting from CCA.

The question is about the accountability to get this done in six months, and whether or not the state is relying on the FEMA funding. It is important to have this done and to bring it back through the committees to talk about that and have that conversation of you know where the study lands what it tells us if it was, you know, if there's more that we need to look at but we did put a date in there to keep ourselves accountable to make sure that we hit that date and bring that before you.

The city of Chicago is adding a director to the Office of Community Engagement who will also serve as the director of veteran affairs. This is in addition to the five other positions that were already included in the budget. Some of the positions have been moved to the Office of Climate and Environmental Equity.

Alderman Villegas is proposing a budget amendment for the Chicago Office of Veteran Affairs, in order to provide more services for returning veterans. The amendment would include additional staffing and a budget increase to 400,000.

The city is working on increasing outreach to the homeless and adding a community liaison position to help bridge the divide between the police and communities. There is some discussion on what a full blown department of environment would look like, but the intention is to get to that point.

The council wants to know why the administration has not reinstituted the Department of Environment and why there is no office of gun violence prevention.

The city does not have a specific office or department for gun violence prevention, but violence prevention is a priority for all city departments. Funding for violence prevention comes from the public health department, and there is a coordinating body (CSCC) that helps to coordinate violence prevention efforts across all city departments.

The city has allocated $5 million for alternative responses to 911 calls, and $80 million for the expansion of the care program.

The city is planning to expand its Community Response Teams program over the next few years, adding more teams and shifts to cover more areas and needs.

The city of Chicago is planning to add additional teams to address substance abuse and other needs in the coming year. The budget for this is $15 million. Some of this money will be used to buy vehicles and some will be used to staff the new teams.

The city is investing $100 million in the police department to improve training, facilities, and vehicles, among other things. The budget does not include any additional funding for police retention, but the city is working on ways to make the department a more attractive place to work, including a mentor program.

The city of Chicago is working closely with the police department to ensure that they have the resources they need. This includes working on the capital plan to improve facilities and vehicles. However, there is a need for more officers to make use of these resources. The city has also received pandemic-related funds from the ARPA which will expire in 2023.

The City of Chicago is being asked to create an Office of Climate and Environmental Equity, which would be responsible for climate change initiatives. The current environmental department is not seen as adequate to the task, and there is concern that the commitment to climate change is not being followed through on.

The chief sustainability officer is responsible for coordinating sustainability efforts across city departments and agencies. The position is appointed by the mayor. The deputy commissioner assists the chief sustainability officer. There are six project managers, a grants research specialist, and an administrative assistant. The office is funded by the city and grant money.

The mayor wants to create an Office of the Environment, which will be overseen by a chief appointed by the city council. The office will eventually become a full department, with its own budget.

The alderman is asking for clarification on the budget for a study on the effects of the Chicago church torture amendment.

The Department of Environment is looking into starting a justice project, and they are looking into the feasibility of this project through a pro bono study. The study will look at the best governance structure for the office, look at gaps and services, and look at sustainable revenue sources.

The city of Chicago should explore sustainable revenue sources to maintain its environmental department in the long term. This scope of study should include understanding the functions of the department and its 250 employees, as well as engaging the public to understand where gaps and services are. The department should be properly funded so that it can continue to do studies and issue permits.

The Commissioner for the Department of Human Services plans to use public funds more efficiently in order to better serve the needs of the community. This includes using public facilities more effectively and repurposing them as needed, as well as looking into private-public partnerships that may be more cost effective for taxpayers.

The city has budgeted for upgrading and improving public facilities, and for the social programming of agencies like CPS. However, there is concern about the level of coordination between these agencies, especially when it comes to addressing youth mental health.

The city of Chicago is committed to improving its mental health facilities and increasing access to mental health services. In 2019, 3600 Chicagoans received mental health services. This year, that number has increased to 60,000, and by the end of the year, it is expected to increase to 75,000. By the end of the year, there will also be a mental health site in every one of the city's 77 communities.

Alderman Seechel Lopez is an environmentalist who has been composting for 20 years. She is excited to answer a question about how the city of Chicago is working to make the planet better. The city has a team of five people working full time on environmental issues, and they have released a climate action plan with a series of strategies. They have also allocated a significant amount of funding to climate and environmental justice priorities.

The City of Chicago has been working hard to allocate its $1 million green jobs fund equitably, and has also been working on a strategy to divert materials from the waste stream. Additionally, the city has committed to planting 75,000 trees over the next five years.

The city is working on a plan to improve the environment, with a focus on community benefits and workforce development. They are also studying the best way to structure the Department of Environment, in order to make sure that progress is not slowed down.

In January 2021, the city of Chicago requested a study on what a department of the environment would look like. Two years later, the city has made sustainability investments and created a decarbonization plan, but there is still more work to be done. Alderman Mitchell believes that the city should create a department dedicated to the environment, and that other colleagues would be excited to work on this issue if given the chance.

Item number eight on the agenda is an ordinance concerning expenditures of 2023. This ordinance will be explained by budget director Susie Park. Item number nine on the agenda is an ordinance approving an intergovernmental agreement with the Chicago Transit Authority in Cook County for the allocation of motor fuel tax funds to the Chicago Transit Authority as year 2023 matching grant pursuant to regional transportation authority act.

The City Council is voting on a measure that will provide funding to the CTA, with the stipulation that the president of the CTA appears before the Council to answer questions. Some council members are opposed to the measure because the president of the CTA has been reluctant to appear before the Council.

This ordinance amends various provisions of the municipal code regarding the organization and functions of city government. It codifies the existing mayor's office of equity and racial justice and establishes the new office of climate and environmental equity. It requires that a study be commissioned to assess the feasibility of creating an Office of Sustainability, and it creates a new position of Chief Sustainability Officer. Article two establishes the Department of Planning and Development as the lead agency for implementing the city's comprehensive plan, and it requires the department to develop a five-year capital improvement plan. Article three establishes the Department of Housing as the lead agency for implementing the city's housing policy, and it requires the department to develop a five-year housing plan. Article four establishes the Department of Transportation as the lead agency for implementing the city's transportation policy, and it requires the department to develop a five-year transportation plan.

This article provides recommendations for the establishment of a department responsible for environmental policymaking and operations. It also clarifies the qualifications for different types of city commissioners, establishes reporting requirements for the chief procurement officer, and increases the salaries of the city clerk and city treasurer.

The new ordinance removes some obsolete language related to debt checks and payment plans for city employees, clarifies the enforcement ability of the office of labor standards, makes some technical amendments to the environmental code, consolidates short-term rental company licensing, and authorizes the commissioner of aviation to amend the Chicago airline terminal consortium agreement. The city is also now guided by the seven principles outlined by the U.S. interagency council on homelessness to address homelessness in Chicago.

The city of Chicago is requiring lobbyists to cooperate with the city in regards to any questions that may arise. This is in addition to the already existing requirements for lobbyists.

The city is trying to compel lobbyists to cooperate with the inspector general, and the mayor shall select a candidate or reject the candidates for reappointment to the police board within 30 days.

The question is about the definition of "diverse" vs "minority." American Indians are included under "diverse," but not "minority." The difference is that "minority" implies a group of people who have been historically excluded, while "diverse" does not.

The city is considering changing the requirements for volunteers, making it so that they would not have to go through a debt check process. The reason for this is to make it easier to hire people.

The city of Chicago is expanding the definition of "worker" to include anyone who may be an independent contractor, in order to better protect their rights. The penalty for violating the new ordinance will be determined by an adjudicator, who could be a judge or a department within the city. The expansion also allows for the issuing of emergency or non-emergency cessation orders to abate any conditions that may threaten public health.

The city of Chicago is proposing a new fee for short-term rental intermediaries, such as Airbnb, of 310 dollars for each rental listing. This is in addition to the existing biennial license fee of 250 dollars. The purpose of the fee is to fund the city's cleanup efforts related to short-term rentals.

The city of Chicago is proposing a new fee for platforms that allow people to rent out their apartments, including Airbnb. The fee would be $310 per unit, per year, and would apply to all platform users, regardless of whether they are renting out one apartment or multiple units. The city is hoping to raise revenue from the fees, as well as crack down on illegal rentals. However, some residents are concerned that the fees could be passed on to tenants, including students who may only be renting for a short period of time.

The speaker is concerned that the average resident who rents out their property to a short-term tenant (e.g. a student for seven months) will have to pay the same registration fee as a company that does short-term rentals. They argue that this is unfair to individuals who are not in the business of renting out their property.

The city council is considering making the emergency procurement authority of the chief procurement officer (CPO) a permanent power. The current threshold for this authority is a million dollars. The rationale for this change is that the cost of goods and services has increased significantly in recent years and is not expected to go back down.

The city council is discussing a change that would give the city more authority over procurement decisions, including those related to life safety, public health, and city operations. The change would take members of the city council out of a lot of conversations and decisions related to these areas.

Alderman She is concerned that the budget department is not giving enough notice or time for review for important ordinances. She suggests having a designated council member responsible for each department to help with this issue.

The budget for this season includes an amendment for salaries for the city clerk, city treasurer, and mayor. The administration has had a lot of time to work on this, but it was only recently put in the inbox for voting. Alderman Tony is frustrated that it was dumped on them at the last minute and wonders if the mayor's salary will be increased. The ordinance states that the mayor's salary will not change until 2024.

Alderman Tony believes that the CPI (Consumer Price Index) should be adjusted every year, but he does not believe in the proposed substitute. He requests that the law department be given five minutes to check if the substitute has been modified.
