The budget amendment for the Chicago Social Justice Memorial was introduced a couple of weeks ago and is scheduled to be heard during agenda item 7A. The memorial is for survivors of police torture, predominantly black and Latinx folks. A survivor said to me not long ago, why does it feel like we're climbing up a mountain that we're supposed to already be on top of? This torture

Mark Clements, a victim of police torture in Chicago, is asking for the city to build a memorial for victims of police torture. He notes that the decision to build the memorial on the south side of Chicago was a collective one reached by survivors of police torture, and that the city has failed to act on this decision for over seven years.

Mark Clements and Joey Mogul, co-founders of the Chicago Torture Justice Memorials, are asking the City Council for funding to build a permanent memorial for the survivors of police torture under former Commander Jon Burge. They note that the city has already paid out $37.5 million in compensation to survivors, and that the memorial would help to address the ongoing trauma experienced by black and brown communities in Chicago.

Chicago torture survivors and family members are asking the city council to add $2.25 million to the budget for a memorial to honor their resilience and perseverance. The city has failed to provide any funding for the memorial, despite promises to do so, and survivors are passing away without seeing the memorial built.

Jeremy Frisch is a resident of the 44th Ward in Chicago. He is concerned about the lack of cleared sidewalks in his neighborhood, especially for those who have limited mobility. He has looked at the data on 311 reports of impassable sidewalks, and finds that all but one member of the City Council has over 100 such reports. He believes that fines for unplowed sidewalks are inequitable, and that the current system is not working.

There have been 20,000 reports of unplowed sidewalks in Chicago since 2019. Given how cumbersome it is to file a 311 report, imagine how many unplowed sidewalks there actually are in the city. The city has chosen to clear the road network of snow, yet only two-thirds of Chicagoans own cars. 100% of Chicagoans use the sidewalk network, whether it's to walk or roll to their vehicle or all the way to their destination. Toronto, a city with the same population as Chicago, has been clearing sidewalks for years. I urge you to support a citywide municipal sidewalk snow removal program and include the $750,000 pilot program in the upcoming city budget.

The speaker is advocating for more funding to be allocated towards snow removal in the city, specifically for clearing sidewalks. They argue that this is necessary to ensure that all residents, including those with disabilities, can safely get around during the winter.

This speaker is asking the City Council to fund a pilot program to plow the sidewalks in Chicago. They argue that this is necessary in order to make the city more accessible for those who do not have cars.

The City of Chicago should set aside budget to clear snow and ice from municipal sidewalks in order to improve accessibility for all residents, especially those who are underserved.

Courtney Cobbs, of the 49th ward, is a co-founder of Better Street Chicago. The organization's goal is to reduce car dependency in the city, in part by making sidewalks more accessible in the winter. In the past, people have been injured after tripping on ice or falling out of strollers because of un shoveled sidewalks. Cobbs argues that the city should do more to clear sidewalks, especially given that property owners are required to get a permit to do any work on city sidewalks.

The speaker is Ella Lubienzki, a resident of the Bucktown neighborhood in Chicago. She is also a film worker in the city. Ella supports the "plow the sidewalks" campaign, as she feels that the current state of sidewalks in Chicago is dangerous, especially for those who are physically active. She also notes that the current state of sidewalks makes it difficult for local businesses in her neighborhood to thrive.

The speaker urges the city to support a pilot program to plow sidewalks, arguing that it is an issue that affects people of all ages, genders, and races. They cite statistics that show that those who need to do local errands are more likely to be women, older, and of lower income. They also mention that as a mother of a three-year-old, they have experienced firsthand the dangers that icy sidewalks can pose.

The individual is speaking at a public meeting and is expressing outrage that the meeting is taking place at 10 a.m. instead of 7 p.m. They believe that this is intentional and that the system is broken. They believe that the public servants present do not want to serve the public.

The City Council is questioning Sandra Blakemore, the Acting Commissioner for the Department of Assets, Information and Services, about her work with the department and its role in providing services for the city. Alderman Osterman asks about the department's plans for helping migrants and the homeless, and Blakemore says she will work with other city departments to find suitable housing for them.

The city of Chicago needs to take a leadership role in identifying efficient ways to use resources, and technology is a key area where improvements can be made. The Economic Capital Technology Committee is working to find ways to use technology to save money and improve services.

Alderman Solowski Garza asks Commissioner Blakemore about the possibility of the city bundling together office expenses like phones and printers in order to get a better price. Commissioner Blakemore says she will look into it, as it is something she believes in doing in order to save the city money.

The City Council is considering appointing Acting Commissioner Blake Moore to the position of Commissioner of the Department of Buildings. Alderman Capelman supports the appointment, citing Moore's experience and commitment to the department. Alderman Spizzato also supports the appointment, saying that he has appreciated Moore's work on the ship so far.

Alderman Lopez congratulates the new acting commissioner and asks if they are aware of the need for ward-specific tax identification numbers.

The individual requesting information would like to know who is paying for the renovations taking place throughout Chicago, and what the standard of care is for individuals being housed by the department.

The city council is discussing appointing Sandra Blake Moore as commissioner of assets, information, and services. Alderman Brookins notes that there is a problem with tax ID numbers, but the city can resolve that. He suggests that the city set up accounts for each individual ward and utilities could be taken out because they shouldn't be charging taxes. The council votes to recommend approval.

Alderman Harris is requesting a transfer of $7,000 from the rental equipment and graphic design budgets to the material and surprise supplies budget. This is in response to committee meetings now being held in person. Alderman Villegas is also requesting a transfer of funds, from personal services to an unknown budget.

This ordinance concerns the transfer of funds within the committee on economic capital and technology department development for the year 2022. The substitute ordinance just transfers funds from personnel services over to contingency. This amount is to be utilized for equipment and supplies and ask for favorable consideration. Alderman Riley moves do pass. All those in favor signify signify by saying aye. Opposed in the opinion of the chair, the eyes have it.

This resolution would make the use of vote centers permanent for election day. This would provide a convenient option for voters who may have difficulty getting to their assigned precinct polling place.

The Chicago City Council is considering a resolution to make early voting sites permanent, in response to concerns about voter suppression. The city currently has 50 early voting sites, but 100 would be preferred. The budget for 100 sites is unknown.

This resolution supports the use of early voting sites on election day in order to alleviate confusion and ensure that people are able to vote.

The speaker is asking how the city is preparing for voter confusion on election day, given the consolidation of polling places. They note that the city has spent money on advertising and outreach, but that there is still likely to be confusion and anger from voters.

The Chicago Board of Elections is urging voters to check their voting information ahead of time on their website or by giving them a call. They have increased staffing for election day, including additional support at election headquarters, to accommodate for the expected high turnout.

The resolution before the committee is to consolidate precincts in order to make voting easier and more accessible for people. This will especially help those who live in high rises and have to vote in their building. The next step is to work with the Board of Election to make sure this gets before the right people, including the governor.

The city council is discussing a change to the polling places for the 2022 election. Currently, voters can only go to their assigned precinct polling place or an early voting site. The proposed change would allow voters to go to any precinct polling place to vote.

The Department of Public Health is requesting to accept additional state grant funds in the amount of $3,000 from the Illinois Department of Public Health for the lead hazard reduction program. The purpose of this program is to maximize the number of children under the age of six who are protected from lead poisoning by undertaking activities include environmental inspections and homes, nursing home case management, community engagements and enforcement activities, if needed to identify and control and control lead based paint hazards and eligible privately owned rental and owner occupied housing populations. The mayor's office for people with disabilities is requesting to accept new federal grant funds in the amount of 425,000 from the US Department of Justice, Justice for the training and services to end violence against women with disabilities. This grant will increase the city's capacity to address gender based violence specifically sexual violence experienced by people with disabilities and deaf individuals. The proposed project seeks to focus on sexual violence experienced by people by individuals with disabilities due to those with disabilities, being at higher risk of sexual violence and individuals who do not have a disability. MOPD will be the central source and will hire one staff person to manage this grant and through the grant MOPD will provide resources on accessibility and best practices and other materials for training and outreach. The Department of Family support services is requesting to accept new public grant funds in

Alderman Tony wants to acknowledge Alderman Ervin, who has joined them for quorum purposes. They discuss the new money for lead poisoning prevention, and how it will be used to remediate lead and other hazards from at least 335 homes by 2026. Alderman Riley moves to pass the ordinance, and it is passed. Item 7a and 7b are on the agenda next. 7a is a direct transmittal and 7b are the original budget recommendations. The proposed annual appropriation ordinance for 2023 is explained by budget director Susie Park.

The city of Chicago's budget director, Susie Park, presented a series of proposed corrections and revisions to the 2023 budget recommendations to the city council. The key items in the amendment include the creation of a new Office of Climate and Environmental Equity, increased funding for the AARP grant, and various technical adjustments in various departments.

Alderman Harrison is questioning how long it took the department to put together the substitute for the management ordinance. Alderman Riley is questioning why the city chose not to create a Department of Environment in the budget this year. The management ordinance is a lot of work that needs to be done to build out a robust department.

The Department of Environment is a new department being created in the city. It is responsible for inspectors and will be commissioning a study to look at where all the roles went. The department will be given a budget and will be expected to grow over time.

The City Council is discussing a proposal to increase pollution control measures. Alderman Riley argues that it is more prudent to increase the budget by 50% instead of 100%. The Chair notes that this will increase the number of labors available for summer work. Alderman Riley agrees that a full department is desired, but understands the desire to walk prudently in this process.

The Department of Environment is in the process of bifurcating all of its responsibilities, and this may have negative consequences for enforcement of environmental policy. The Department of Public Health is currently responsible for enforcement of environmental policy, but this may change in the future. The task force related to overall sanitation collection is currently reviewing the garbage collection efforts to see if they can be improved.

The Office of Climate and Environmental Equity is a new office that will be responsible for coordinating the city's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and advance environmental and sustainability priorities. The office will be headed by the chief sustainability officer, who will be responsible for overseeing the office's work.

The city should have a centralized climate office to help coordinate efforts to transition to clean energy. This office should engage with alderman and the public to get input on climate planning and implementation.

The Department of Environment was shuttered in 2012 by Rahm Emanuel, and Mayor Lightfoot promised to bring it back in her 2019 policy platform. However, the budget for this year does not include funding for the department. Alderman Ramirez Rosa argues that this is disingenuous and that the administration has had four years to get the department up and running.

The budget for the City of Chicago includes funding for a Department of the Environment and for the Chicago torture justice memorial.

The budget fails to reopen shuttered mental health clinics, and also continues to fund ShotSpotter technology despite serious doubts about its effectiveness.

This study will look at the feasibility of different roles and responsibilities within the city government's Department of Environment. It will be funded by pro bono consulting services, and will involve a robust stakeholder process to get input from those who serve within the city and from across the city.

The goal of the study is to identify the best possible governance structure. It is interesting because it is a pro bono study through CCA. The accountability is that there is a date set to keep the study on track and to bring it before the committees. The last question was about funding for asylum seekers and whether or not nonprofits have submitted budgeting for reimbursements.

The city is adding a director to the Office of Community Engagement in the mayor's office, which is separate from the mayor's office. The new director will serve as the director of veteran affairs. The budget for the new office is three positions.

The budget includes an engagement officer for the Chicago Office of Veteran Affairs, which was not funded in 2019. Alderman Harrison is requesting that the position be titled as the director of the office and that it be given a budget of $400,000 to adequately staff the office and provide services to veterans.

Alderman Austin discusses the budget for the Department of Environment and expresses curiosity about who is against the department. He notes that the black caucus, progressive caucus, and Latino caucus all support the department.

The administration is proposing to create a new Department of Housing and Development, and Councilmember Johnson wants to make sure that it is done right this time. He points out that the last time a housing department was created, it was done without any study or planning, and it was not successful. He wants to make sure that this new department is well-funded and staffed so that it can be successful in its mission.

The city does not have a specific office or department devoted to gun violence prevention, but various city departments are working on violence prevention efforts. The speaker suggests that an office or department devoted to gun violence prevention would help to clarify the city's priorities.

The city is allocating funds for gun violence prevention and has reallocated $80 million for this purpose. They are also expanding the care program, which is an alternative response to 911 calls, and have allocated $15 million for this expansion.

The city is allocating 15 million dollars to expand a pilot program that provides social services to high-needs areas. The expansion will include additional teams and shifts, as well as a focus on substance abuse.

The city is adding a fourth team focused on substance abuse, and looking to add second shifts to existing teams. This is in response to data showing increased needs in certain parts of the city. The funding for this comes from the AARP fund, which will cover costs through 2026.

The budget for CPS is 60 million, with 7 million allocated towards pensions. There are no additional edits for programming related to police retention.

The city received ARPA funds as part of the local fiscal recovery, but it is unclear how much is left for the 2023-24 cycle. The budget office is working closely with the police department to ensure that they have the resources they need, but it is important to understand what is left of the ARPA funds before making any decisions.

The city council is discussing the expiration dates of different grant programs, and how they can impact the city's ability to get things done. They are also discussing the environmental department that was supposed to have been created, and how it has not yet been fully realized.

The Office of Climate and Environmental Equity is responsible for climate change initiatives. It is staffed with a chief sustainability officer, a deputy commissioner, grant specialists, and project managers. There is some concern that there is not enough interagency coordination between this office and other medical offices.

The Office of Sustainability is a new, standalone office that will be responsible for environmental initiatives in the city. The office will be headed by a sustainability officer, who will be appointed by the mayor and approved by the city council. The office will have a budget and will come before the council for budget hearings like other city departments. The goal is to eventually expand the office into a full-fledged department.

The city council is discussing the budget and a possible rename of the committee that doesn't exist before George walks out the door. Alderman O'Shea suggested that maybe Alderman cardness could organize the contest of renaming the committee.

The speaker is questioning why, in a budget of $16 billion, the city is relying on a pro bono study to assess the environmental impact of future permits. They argue that this is not satisfactory and that a fully funded study should be possible.

The city of Chicago is looking into the feasibility of creating a Department of Environment, and they are looking for sustainable revenue sources to fund it. They are also looking at the functions of the department and how to best engage the public to understand the department's goals.

The police department is facing vacancies and capital planning issues. The Commissioner is committed to addressing these issues and making sure that the department is properly funded.

The Aldermen are concerned about the lack of coordination between agencies when it comes to youth programming and the allocation of funding to address youth mental health.

The city of Chicago is committed to improving its mental health facilities and increasing access to mental health services. In 2019, 3600 Chicagoans received mental health services, and this number is expected to increase to 60,000 by the end of 2020. By the end of 2020, there will also be a high-quality mental health clinic in every one of Chicago's 77 communities.

The council has supported the growth of a real safety net system in the city of Chicago, which has more than doubled the CD pH staff working on mental health since 2019. Alderman Seechel Lopez emphasizes the importance of taking action to save the planet. He believes that a pilot or study will help to speed up efforts to make the planet better.

The City of Chicago has a team of five full-time employees working on environmental initiatives, including a climate action plan and tree-planting strategy. The City has allocated $188 million to climate and environmental justice priorities, and is working with various departments to implement these initiatives.

The Department of Environment is expanding its capacity and working with other departments on initiatives to improve the environment. They are excited to continue their momentum and explore what a permanent structure for the department would look like.

The Alderman is supportive of the work being done to expand care teams and believes that anyone experiencing a mental health crisis should receive a mental health treatment response. They would like to see a department of the environment established, with a study conducted to determine how best to build it out over the next year. There is a motion to recommend approval of item seven and seven be on the agenda.

The City Council is voting on a number of items, including expenditures for the year 2023. One item is an agreement with the Chicago Transit Authority for the allocation of motor fuel tax funds to the Chicago Transit Authority as a year 2023 matching grant.

The city of Chicago has agreed to allocate three million dollars from its motor fuel tax funds to the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) in Cook County. This is an annual allocation provided by the city. The CTA is required to receive five million dollars from Cook County and the city of Chicago in order to receive funds from the Regional Transportation Authority (RTA). The city provides three million of the five million annual requirement while Cook County provides the two million.

The City Council has voted to pass a measure requiring the CTA executive to appear before the body to answer questions on safety and other issues.

The 2023 management ordinance codifies the existing mayor's office of equity and racial justice, establishes the new office of climate and environmental equity, and requires that a study be commissioned to provide recommendations by June 30th, 2023 regarding the establishment of a department responsible for environmental policymaking and operations. It also gives diverse the same meaning as minority in sections two dash 92 dash 670 n in order to expand the definition to include the people indigenous to the Americas.

The city council has passed a number of measures designed to protect public health and improve working conditions for city employees. Among other things, the council has given the commissioner of public health the authority to establish quarantine regulations, increased the salaries of the city clerk and city treasurer, and exempted volunteers from indebtedness requirements. The council has also clarified the ability of the office of labor standards to enforce worker protection laws and authorized the department of public health to abate public nuisances. Finally, the council has established an administrative process for the transfer of ownership of properties receiving out-of-city water service.

The proposed ordinance makes changes to the way water service fees are calculated and collected, consolidates short-term rental company licensing under one intermediary license, and authorizes the commissioner of aviation to amend the Chicago airline terminal consortium agreement.

The code already requires lobbyists to cooperate with investigations, and this is just a clarification that they are also included in the category of people who must cooperate. The city has the authority to compel lobbyists to cooperate because they are already registered with the city and have a license to lobby.

The question is whether there is a typo in the sentence. The sentence says that within 30 days after the mayor selects a candidate, the commission shall provide the mayor with a written explanation. The question is whether the person selected is a reappointment candidate. If the person is a reappointment candidate, then they would have to be a candidate. However, if the person is not a reappointment candidate, then they would not have to be a candidate.

The African American, Hispanic, Asian American, and American Indian groups are all considered minorities. However, by using the term "diverse," you create a situation where minorities can continue to be discriminated against. The comptroller clarified that the debt check section is for a process that the city already does for all new employees, and that volunteers would not have to go through the debt check process as long as they're not a part of a commission.

The City of Chicago is trying to modernize its process for handling labor standards violations, making it easier for people to come forward with complaints. The office is expanding its definition of "employee" to include "worker," in order to cover more potential cases.

The ordinance being discussed would allow the Department of Public Health to issue orders to clean up conditions that pose a threat to public health, and would also establish a licensing fee for short-term residential rentals.

The city of Chicago is proposing a new fee for companies that offer short-term rentals, such as Airbnb. The fee would be $250 for the company, plus $60 for each rental unit. This would apply to any company that offers short-term rentals, regardless of the number of units they have available. The city is hoping to generate revenue from this new fee, as well as to ensure that all companies offering short-term rentals are registered and following the proper procedures.

The city of Chicago requires that all short-term rental platforms be licensed, and that all hosts be registered with the city. Hosts are required to pay a registration fee of 125 per unit. The city is considering exempting individual hosts with only one or two units from this requirement.

The city is proposing to make the emergency procurement authority of the chief procurement officer permanent, keeping the threshold at a million dollars. This would remove the council from a lot of conversations and give the cpo more power.

The city council is considering making permanent an emergency procurement power that would allow the city to bypass normal city council oversight for transactions over $1 million. The emergency authority is currently only exercised for transactions over $500,000. The city council member raising the question wants to know how many transactions fall in the range between $500,000 and $1 million.

The alderman is discussing the possibility of someone creating their own website to list short-term rentals. They are concerned about the lack of regulation around these platforms and want to see a list of the platforms that are available.

The council member is suggesting that, in the future, someone be put in charge of a department so that budget management ordinances can be better monitored. They are frustrated that these ordinances are often dumped on them at the last minute with little time to review them. The only salary change being proposed is for the city clerk and city treasurer in 2023.

Alderman Tony is questioning whether the mayor's salary should be increased in 2024. He does not believe that the CPI adjustment should be automatic, and he would like to see the law department check to see if the substitute has been modified.
