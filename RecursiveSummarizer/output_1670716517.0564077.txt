Patricia Davis of Unique Case Work Installation criticizes the Chicago Housing Authority's (CHA) job program, arguing that it has disadvantaged black contractors and taken away pride from black men in the community. She calls for the program to be reinstated.

Black businessmen in Chicago are being denied renewals on their contracts, despite being promoted earlier in the year. This is just one example of the many atrocities that black businessmen face all the time. Without self-employment, black communities will never have self-empowerment.

The speaker discusses how franchises can help black communities, and how he was able to help an Ottoman microscot to design a community training workshop. He talks about how this interaction can make a difference for black youth, and how the Section 3 program is beneficial for young people.

Reverend Jackson meets with ex-offenders every Thursday in an effort to help them find work and stay out of crime. The program has been successful in helping some ex-offenders find jobs and start their own businesses. However, the program is not reaching all ex-offenders, and many are still resorting to crime. Reverend Jackson is urging officials to do more to help ex-offenders find work and turn their lives around.

This individual is discussing their experience as a contractor with the CHA job program, and how they believe African Americans have been treated unfairly. They mention being passed over for promotion and not being given any work, despite being the only fire protection company in the program. They also discuss how they were able to take some CHA residents and put them into their mentor protege program, but had to let them go because of the lack of work from CHA.

This ordinance would require the city to increase the number of minority- and women-owned businesses it contracts with. The ordinance would also require the city to increase the utilization of minority- and women-owned businesses in its construction projects.

The City of Chicago's job program is a tool used to get work done in the city, with an emphasis on contracting opportunities for minority-owned businesses. In the previous administration, some African-American businesses felt they were being shut out of job contracts. Since then, job contracts have been made available in several departments, including the Department of Transportation, water management, AIS, and the Chicago Housing Authority. This hearing is to shine a light on the program and find out how it is being used by different departments.

The City of Chicago has various job order contracts that are used for small to medium sized projects. The award for the contract goes to the general contractor that offers the most favorable combined adjustment factors for two types of work - work during normal business hours and work for other than normal business hours. The unit price book and catalogs are the factors that the job counter have to use.

The book is specific to the Midwest industry and construction costs for the items. The bidder can either bid the price of the book, lower or higher. And the JOC contracts are used to respond to task orders related to the user department specific scope of work. The value of the JOC contract depends upon the department needs and their budget. No projects are identified at the time of bidding. Contract is for a fixed term and has the potential dollar value, a minimum and a maximum dollar value.

The city of Chicago has 12 JOC contracts with various contractors for different types of work. The contracts are reviewed by DPS, and if they don't meet the goals of the project, the contractor is required to submit a letter explaining why and outlining their intent to meet the goals on future projects.

There are eight contracts listed. Three are for the Department of Transportation, two are for the Department of Aviation, two are for the City Light, and one is for the AIS environmental section. All of the firms listed are NBEs, and none of them are certified.

The scope of the work is for the remediation of contaminated sites. The old veteran is not certified. The next one just shows that the AIS environmental contract was broken down into two areas, North and South of Madison. And once again, old veteran has both problems. It's for the, like I said, remediation of contaminated sites and old veteran is not certified. Now I'm going back to the zones of AIS zone number four. We talked about two zones. So this is the third one, zone number four. The general contractor is Pacific Construction Services. And once again, it's for general construction, Pacific Construction Services is not a certified firm. And the last one is for AIS zone two, the general contractor is Paul Borg Construction. Once again, for general construction and Paul Borg is not certified.

The JOC program is designed for prime contractors to have an easy contract with the city of Chicago. The contractor can sub out as much of the work as they need to.

The JOC program allows for a high percentage of the contract to be subcontracted out to MBE/WBE businesses. The city monitors the progress of these businesses to ensure that they are meeting the goals of the contract.

The Department of Commerce Service has requested a job order contract, which is based on their budget and needs. If the department feels that their budget only allows for a two year agreement, then that's what they request. Otherwise, they may request more or less time. It is up to the department to determine when they requested the contract and how long it will be.

The JOC contract is used to fill in gaps for projects that the in-house forces can't complete. This includes flat work, site work, some CDOT jurisdiction plazas, and unique crosswalks. The JOC contract is also used for structures, bridges, and viaducts.

The Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT) has secured two new JOC contracts, with M&W firms as their primaries. The contracts have a initial term of two years, with two one-year extensions available. The dollar value of the contracts is capped at the current amount, but CDOT can submit for a vendor limit increase if necessary.

The Department of Procurement Services has a process to increase the dollar value of contracts by up to 50%. This is done in response to requests from vendors and is based on the expected usage of the contract. The department also monitors task orders to ensure that MBE and WBE percentages are met.

The JOC program is a way for the city to respond immediately to construction needs for facilities. The four JOC contracts were awarded in 2021 and cover projects for all citywide facilities. The program is effective because it allows for a quick response to time constraints.

AIS encourages contractors to reach beyond their typical subcontractors to find businesses of diverse backgrounds for the city's 25% MBE and 5% WBE requirements. There is a challenge in finding qualified minority or women-owned businesses, but AIS has implemented outreach programs to help facilitate this.

The city of Chicago is looking to improve its minority business participation, and has asked the Audubon Society for help. The Society says it is up for the challenge, and that it is always looking for new ways to improve. However, the city's procurement program is set up for the lowest bidder, and this can sometimes mean that minority-owned businesses are not given a fair chance to compete. The city is hoping to change this, and is asking the Audubon Society for help in increasing minority participation.

The city should consider a vendor's ability to meet the requirements of the project when evaluating bids, rather than simply selecting the lowest bidder. This will ensure that the city gets the best value for its money. Additionally, the city should evaluate whether any of the bids for the JOC contract include preferences or credits that could save the city money.

The city is looking for a contractor to meet certain qualifications in order to be considered responsible. Incentives are available for the contractor, but they are not required. The maximum contract value is unknown.

The company is considering using the SBI, MBI format for smaller task orders, but is hesitant because it would take away work from the minority firms that were just awarded as primes. The company is also unsure if the SBI, MBI firms tend to be MBE or WBE certified.

The Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) has established a pool of pre-qualified contractors, known as job order contracting vendors, with businesses that meet the federal government's Section 3 requirements. In 2020, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) implemented new Section 3 requirements for all public housing authorities across the country that focus on labor hour benchmarks instead of percentage of the contract value. The CHA's contractors must now meet targets of labor hours for CHA residents and participants, low-income residents of Chicago, and residents of areas of high poverty in Chicago.

The Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) has a pre-qualified pool of contractors for maintenance work, which is established every two to four years. The most recent procurement was in July 2020. Many of the previous contractors are in the current pool. The changes to how the Section 3 pool is managed were made to provide closer tracking and oversight of the work being done.

The Section 3 rule requires that federal housing dollars be spent in a way that creates employment and economic opportunities for low- and very low-income people, especially those involved in HUD housing programs. CHA will begin reporting on its compliance with the new rule this year.

The Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) has implemented a new program to ensure that a certain percentage of its construction and professional service contracts are awarded to businesses that employ low- or very low-income individuals. This program, called Section 3, requires that 25% of labor hours go to businesses or individuals meeting the low-income criteria. The goal of the program is to create opportunities and long-term employment retention for low-income residents of Chicago.

The Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) has a program in place that ensures that at least 10% of the value of all contracts goes to businesses registered under Section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act. Additionally, 25% of all labor hours on CHA projects must be carried out by Section 3 businesses. There have been some complaints from contractors about the program, but CHA has been working to reach out to those affected and help them transition into the new system.

The Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) has a pool of pre-qualified vendors for its contracting work, and requires that private property managers and developers use Section 3 businesses and workers for unit turn work. This work is now being done primarily by private property management firms, and is restricted to only Section 3 companies. The budget for unit turns is what is needed to meet CHA's core mission of housing people.

The question is about how to meet the goal of 10% Section 3 participation on a project when there are only a few signatory Section 3 contractors. CHA says that they don't look at union vs. non-union as a metric, but rather focus on whether the contractor is certified and has the appropriate number of labor hours, etc.

The Chicago Housing Authority (CHA) has changed its program for awarding contracts to comply with new rules from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The old program used a third-party consultant, but the new program will allow CHA to track how its taxpayer dollars are being spent.

The City of Chicago is working to increase equity in its contracting process by ensuring that more money is reinvested back into the community. The goal is to reduce the amount of money spent on third-party contractors and instead use that money to invest in programs that benefit the community.

The committee on contract oversight and equity is adjourned. Thank you for joining us. We'll see you later.
