The City of Chicago is proposing an ordinance that would require contractors to hire a certain percentage of socioeconomically disadvantaged workers for construction projects. Chief Procurement Officer Eileen Velasquez will explain the ordinance, followed by Q&A from industry members and the public.

The proposed amendment to the ordinance removes the project area residency requirement and replaces it with a new requirement that the total hours worked on the project must be performed by residents of social economically disadvantaged areas. The contractor and subcontractor can staff their workforce with individuals who are from any area of the designation, within the designation and their work hours will count towards the requirement.

The ordinance being discussed is for the hiring of construction workers for a project in a socially disadvantaged area. The community that is hosting the project should have first consideration for the workforce, but if there are not enough residents from that area that meet the requirements, then workers from other socially disadvantaged areas in the city can be hired.

The ordinance being discussed would require contractors to hire from socioeconomically disadvantaged areas for city projects. Alderman Sawyer, who sponsored the ordinance, says that he would not have an objection to giving preference to the community where the project is located.

The City of Chicago is proposing an ordinance that would give preference to local residents for jobs on city projects. The biggest concern with this ordinance is that it would result in people being hired for three weeks and then let go. Alderman Rodriguez is concerned about how this ordinance will specifically address that issue. Brian Hacker from the Department of Planning and Development explains that the ordinance is based on census tract data that does not take into account undocumented residents.

The map of Chicago's 14th ward is based on data from the US Census Bureau's 2014 American Community Survey. There is concern that the map does not accurately capture all residents, particularly undocumented immigrants.

The city ordinance being discussed stipulates that a certain percentage of workers for city projects must come from the local community. Alderman Villegas asks why the number is 25%, and is told that it is the lowest quartile of income earners in the city. There is no specific cutoff for the 25%, it is just the lowest quartile.

Higher 360 is a new organization that aims to help eradicate poverty in Chicago by providing guaranteed basic income to low-income residents. DPD is working on a project to map out what areas would be most helped by this initiative. However, as the area expands, the ability to lift people out of poverty decreases.

The Chicago Infrastructure Trust is working to ensure that the $100 billion in mega projects coming to the city over the next 10-15 years is done equitably and inclusively. They are doing this by scaling up diverse contractors and suppliers, and by working with schools and community organizations to encourage young people to enter the trades. They are also working with workforce development partners to help recruit individuals from socioeconomically disadvantaged areas and connect them to work.

The ordinance being discussed would give preference to socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals when awarding construction contracts. The project area would be defined as the area where the construction project is taking place.

The proposed ordinance defines "project area resident" as a person who lives in the part of the city designated as the project area in the information for bidders issued by the Department of Procurement Services. This allows for a more objective view of who is considered a project area resident, rather than relying on the Department of Planning's definition.

The city of Chicago is changing its requirements for contractors to include more socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals, with the goal of increasing inclusion and opportunity. The city has also started collecting data on contractor payrolls to ensure that the goals are being met.

The goal of this project is to help socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals. In 2019, a change was made to give access to a tool that would help track this goal. In 2021, $23,000 was collected in penalties because the data is now at the forefront of the project.

The proposed ordinance is designed to ensure that wealth is shared among all members of the community, and includes a 1.20% penalty for those who do not meet the goal. In 2021, the penalty was $23,000, which represented a 20th of 1% of the total work done that year.

Alderman Villegas has proposed raising the threshold for city contracts in an effort to increase equity in hiring. However, some colleagues are concerned that this could unintentionally exclude certain populations.

This ordinance requires contractors doing business with the city to hire a certain percentage of employees from disadvantaged backgrounds. This is intended to help those who are economically disadvantaged get jobs.

The goal is to work toward giving individuals opportunities, especially those in high unemployment communities. One way to do this is to create longer-term opportunities, so that people are not just working for a short time and then being dropped from the project. Another way is to incentivize contractors to keep individuals working.

The question is whether or not the city is doing enough to incentivize contractors to hire employees from the same community in which the project is taking place. Anecdotally, it seems that this is not happening very often, and that it may be due to the city's requirements. It is unclear whether or not there is any empirical evidence to support this claim.

This was a subject matter hearing on a proposed ordinance to help lift the city's good faith effort requirement when it comes to hiring locally. The committee discussed the feedback they received and how they plan to address it in a future substitute ordinance. No action was taken on the proposed ordinance at this time.
