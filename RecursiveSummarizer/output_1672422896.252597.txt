The Chicago Social Justice Memorial is a proposed budget amendment that would allocate funds to create a memorial in honor of social justice activists. The amendment is being considered by the budget committee, and Bartley is urging the committee to approve the amendment.

The Chicago Social Justice Memorial was proposed in 2015 as a way to honor survivors of police torture, but seven years later, no memorial has been built. The author argues that the delay is due to a lack of funding and political will. They are asking for $2.25 million to build the memorial.

Mark Clements, a survivor of police torture, is calling for the city of Chicago to build a memorial for victims of police torture. He says that the decision to build the memorial on the south side of Chicago was a collective one reached by survivors of police torture, and that the city has failed to act on this decision for over seven years. Clements argues that the harm of police torture upon communities of Chicago have left them traumatized and without any place for treatment, and that the city needs to do something to address this issue.

The Chicago torture justice center was established to help those who have had loved ones incarcerated for long periods of time due to police torture. The center has helped to bring awareness of the impact of trauma that the black and brown communities have had to endure. Funding is being requested for the building of the Chicago torture justice memorial.

We are asking for $2.25 million to be added to the budget for a Chicago torture justice memorials planning grant. This is urgent because survivors and family members are passing away. The lack of commitment and funding for this memorial is traumatizing survivors again.

The city of Chicago does not clear sidewalks of snow, leaving many people stranded. This is especially difficult for those who use wheelchairs or have strollers. Toronto, a city with the same population, has been clearing sidewalks for years and the author urges the committee to do the same.

The city is considering a municipal sidewalk snow removal program, which would include a $750,000 pilot program. This would help those who have difficulty getting around when sidewalks are snow-covered, including people with disabilities and those who rely on public transportation.

Cheryl Nell Lane, a disabled resident of Chicago, discusses the difficulties of getting around during winter due to the lack of snow removal from sidewalks. She argues that this is a problem for all residents, not just those with disabilities, and that the current fines for not clearing sidewalks are not enough to incentivize people to do the work. Claire Falk, a mother of three, talks about how dangerous it is to have to walk in the street with small children due to the lack of clear sidewalks.

Abla Garib is a motorized wheelchair user who lives in the city. She is urging the City Council to fund the plowing of sidewalks, as she has often been unable to make doctor appointments or get to the end of her block due to snow and ice.

Chicago residents are calling on the city to set aside budget to clear snow and ice from municipal sidewalks, as not doing so creates accessibility issues for pedestrians, especially those with disabilities.

The goal of Better Street Chicago is to reduce car dependency in the city, and one way to do that is by ensuring that sidewalks are accessible for everyone in the winter. The campaign has received hundreds of emails from people, including parents, about how difficult it is to get around when sidewalks are not shoveled. The city has approved $12.5 million for the Chicago MOOST program, but most of that money has gone to oil and gas companies. Better Street Chicago is advocating for the city to use some of that money to clear sidewalks in the winter, so that everyone can have access to the city.

The city of Chicago is considering a pilot program to plow the sidewalks in order to improve accessibility and safety for residents. The program would cost $750,000 to implement.

Mr. Blakemore is upset that he wasn't called to speak at the meeting, and accuses the Alderman of being anti-participation and silencing him. Ms. King speaks about her experience as a disabled mother, and asks for the pilot program to plow the sidewalks to be passed.

The individual is angry that the council is meeting at 10 a.m. rather than 7 p.m., preventing the public from attending. They are also mad that there are empty seats, suggesting that the council does not want the public there. This concludes the public comment period.

Alderman Osterman calls on the Managing Deputy of Finance and Human Resources to take a leadership role in finding housing for migrants and the homeless before winter sets in. He believes that the Department of Assets, Information, and Services is best suited to coordinate this effort citywide.

The city of Chicago is looking to invest in technology in order to improve efficiency and save money. Alderman Villegas is excited about the appointment of Acting Commissioner Blake Moore and looks forward to working with him on this issue.

Alderman Capelman supports Chairman Osterman's proposal to use vacant religious buildings as housing for the homeless. He believes that the Roman Catholic Church's mission to help those who are most vulnerable ties in with the city's mission as well.

Alderman Hairston and Alderman Lopez congratulate Acting Commissioner Blake Moore on her confirmation as Commissioner of the Department of Buildings. Alderman Hairston asks if Commissioner Moore is related to George Blake Moore, and Commissioner Moore defers to her husband.

The City of Chicago has instructed its departments to not text with Alderman. This is a policy that comes from the office of the Alderman. There is no automatic reply for this policy.

Alderman Beale asks about the cost of renovations for AIS sites and the standard of care for individuals housed at those sites. Commissioner Kanazi says that the Department of Family and Support Services will address those questions after the meeting.

Alderman Harris is proposing a transfer of $7,000 from the rental equipment and graphic design budgets to the material and supplies budget for the year 2022. This is necessary because committee meetings are now being held in person.

The committee is addressing budget transfers, with one item concerning the transfer of funds for court reporter services associated with mandatory SSA public hearings. The introduced ordinance stated $404,250 while the substitute ordinance corrects that amount to $6,000. The committee passes the substitute ordinance.

This resolution calls for the Illinois General Assembly to include provisions in future election-related legislation to make central vote centers permanent. This would allow for more flexibility and convenience for voters in Chicago.

The city of Chicago has allowed early voting sites to be open on election day for the last three elections, and this temporary legislation is set to expire at the end of this year. The city is in support of making this permanent so that early voting sites can continue to be used as vote centers on election day.

Alderman Austin is urging the city council to support a resolution maintaining access to the ballot for all people in Illinois. She notes that 100 early voting sites would be ideal for upcoming elections. Alderman Rodriguez seconds the motion, and Alderman Garza thanks them both.

This resolution supports the expansion of voting rights and early voting sites across the country. In Chicago, there will be 51 early voting sites open on election day. This temporary legislation does stop at the end of this year. The only legislature takes us up and makes this permanent. We'll have this in place for the upcoming municipal elections as well.

The Chicago Board of Elections is preparing for the upcoming election by advertising, sending out voter information, and increasing staffing. Voters can check their voting information online or by calling the Board of Elections.

The Chicago Board of Elections is preparing for a busy election day, with many people expected to go to the wrong polling place. They are urging people to check their polling place in advance, and will have additional resources available on election day to help people find their correct polling place or vote center.

The resolution is to support the consolidation of precincts in the city of Chicago. This will mean that each precinct will have a polling place that is closer to the voters in that precinct. The next step is to work with the Board of Election to make sure that this gets before the right people, including the governor.

The city council is discussing an amendment to the annual appropriation ordinance for the mayor's office for people with disabilities. The amendment includes a request for federal grant funds in the amount of $16 million from the federal emergency management agency for the emergency food and shelter program.

The Department of Housing is requesting additional federal grant funds to provide rental assistance payments to tenants and landlords under the federal emergency rental assistance program. The Department of Public Health is requesting additional federal grant funds to support public health surveillance and response to infectious diseases, including testing for covert 19 and monitoring of covert 19 variants.

The Department of Public Health is requesting to accept additional state grant funds in the amount of $20,000 from the Illinois Department of Public Health for the body art and tanning inspection program. The purpose of this program is to provide basic levels of protection of infectious diseases and body and tanning facilities across the city to meet the health code regulations. This increase in funds supports additional facility inspections that were closed during the pandemic. The Department of Public Health is also requesting to accept additional federal grant funds in the amount of $126,000 from the US Department of Health and Human Services for the HIV behavioral surveillance program. The purpose of this program is to provide monitoring of high risk behaviors for people, specifically men having sex with men and high risk heterosexuals using intravenous drugs. Lastly, the Department of Public Health is requesting to accept new federal grant funds in the amount of $8,700,000 from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development for the lead hazard reduction program. The purpose of this program is to identify and control lead based paint hazards and eligible privately owned rental and owner occupied housing populations.

The Illinois Department of Public Health is requesting $36 million in grant funding from the US Department of Justice to increase access to HIV prevention medication and navigational services, with a focus on those with disabilities who are at higher risk of sexual violence. The Department of Family Support Services is also requesting $2 million in grant funding from the Chicago Transit Authority to support outreach services for unsheltered residents utilizing CTA space for shelter.

The CTA will be allocating $2 million to help with the homeless problem in Chicago. This is in addition to what the Department of Family and Support Services already does. The money will go towards agencies that help the homeless.

The city of Chicago has received a large grant from HUD to remediate lead and other hazards in335 homes by 2026.

Alderman Riley has proposed a series of corrections and revisions to the 2023 budget recommendations, including the creation of a new Office of Climate and Environmental Equity. The proposed annual appropriation ordinance for 2023 will be explained by the city's budget director, Susie Park.

The city of Chicago is creating a new office with various responsibilities for sustainability, veterans affairs, and homelessness. This office will have 10 budgeted positions, including a chief sustainability officer, grants research specialists, and project managers. Additionally, four positions will be added to the homeless services division within the Department of Family Support Services, and a director position will be added at DFS to lead the assistance for the city's new arrivals initiative.

The city is creating an Office of Climate and Environmental Equity, which will study whether a separate Department of Environment is needed. The decision to not create a Department of Environment this year was met with criticism, as many believe that the city needs one. This office is a first step in potentially creating a department in the future.

The city is considering creating a new pollution control department, and one Alderman suggests starting small and gradually growing the department over time. Another Alderman asks about the budget for the new department, and is told that it would be similar to other city departments.

The city is budgeting for a new Office of Climate and Environmental Equity, which will be responsible for policy and planning around environmental issues. Enforcement of environmental regulations will remain with the Department of Public Health and Buildings for the time being.

The alderman discuss the importance of having a Department of Environment and the chief sustainability officer confirms that they will be running the office.

The Office of Climate and Environmental Equity is responsible for coordinating the city's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and advance environmental and sustainability priorities. The office will work cross-sectorally across all city departments to achieve these goals.

The idea of strategically planning includes the alderman, according to the person speaking. They say that many processes have been created by which alderman have been engaged, and that they are proud of the work that has been done so far. However, the question is raised as to whether alderman are getting a salary increase as part of this process.

The mayor's office budget is equal. However, the administration talked about re-implementing a department environment, and it is something that is needed. Without it, there is a risk of the mayor's office becoming ineffective.

The budget for the City of Chicago includes funding for a planning process for a Chicago torture justice memorial, as well as for ShotSpotter technology. Some City Council members have criticized the budget for not reopening any of the shuttered mental health clinics.

The alderman is disappointed with the budget, specifically the lack of funding for mental health clinics and the ShotSpotter program. They are concerned that the proposed study for the Department of Environment is not clear on what it will be studying.

The City of San Francisco is looking to study the enforcement of different pieces of its code, and is looking to do so quickly and efficiently. The study will be conducted with the help of pro bono consulting from CCA, and will involve a robust stakeholder process to ensure that the best possible governance structure is put in place.

The question is about the accountability to get this done in six months, and whether the state is relying on the 'shall' in the projected timeline. It is important to have this done and to bring it back through the committees to talk about where the study lands and what it tells us. The appropriation for the female appropriation for reimbursements or funding for asylum seekers is for 16 million to get us through the end of this year.

The City of Chicago is adding a director to the Office of Community Engagement in the mayor's office, which will serve as the director of veteran affairs. This is in addition to the other five positions that were already included in the budget. Some positions have been moved to the Office of Climate and Environmental Equity. The budget amendment that reinstates the Chicago Office of Veteran Affairs is being supported by colleagues.

Alderman Austin is asking for a budget amendment to create the position of Director of Chicago Veteran Affairs, with a budget of at least $400,000. This position would be responsible for providing services to the thousands of veterans returning to Chicago. Alderman Austin has the support of 35 other Alderman, and is willing to negotiate the budget amount.

The city is adding four more positions for homeless outreach and creating a new position for community liaison in the police department to help improve relations between the police and the community. There is some discussion about what a full-blown department of environment would look like, but the intention is to eventually create one.

The administration is considering adding a Department of Environment and an office of gun violence prevention. Some members of the Council believe these additions would clarify the city's priorities.

The city does not have a specific office for gun violence prevention, but all departments are working on violence prevention. The city has a coordinating body for violence prevention, and last year allocated over 100 for gun violence prevention.

The CRP has allocated $15 million for the expansion of the care program in 2023. This year, they have budgeted $2 million to move the pilot forward.

The city is looking to deepen its investments in the communities where the pilot program is currently functioning. This includes adding a second shift for all three teams, as well as expanding the program geographically.

The city of Chicago is planning to add additional teams to address substance abuse and other needs in the coming year. The plan will cost $15 million, which is funded through the AARP. Additionally, there is money allocated in the budget for lead line replacement.

The budget for the lead service line replacement program is 60 million. The CPS question is how much of that is dedicated to CPS. The answer is that there are no specific funds for CPS, but the pension costs are dedicated to CPS.

The city of Chicago is working closely with the police department to ensure that they have the resources they need. This includes working on the capital plan to improve facilities and vehicles. However, there is a need for more cops to make use of these resources. The city has also received ARPA funds, which expire at different dates. It is important to know what is left of these funds so that they can be properly budgeted for the upcoming year.

The Office of Climate and Environmental Equity is asking for more information on the budget for environmental programs. They want to see the impact of the money being spent and what is being done with it. They would like to see an environmental office created that is focused on climate change.

The Chief Sustainability Officer will be responsible for coordinating sustainability efforts across the city, including working with other agencies and departments. The position is appointed by the mayor.

The city council will vote on the appointment of a chief for the new Office of the Environment. This office will be responsible for leading the way to a more robust department, with a goal of being fully operational by 2024.

The question is about whether or not the city can afford to fund a study on the impacts of the proposed Chicago torture justice memorial, and whether or not an amendment promised for the memorial is also being funded. The answer is that the city can't afford to fund the study, but they are working on getting pro bono help for it. The amendment is still being planned.

The Department of Environment is planning to start a justice project with the help of a pro bono study. The goal of the study is to figure out the best governance structure for the office, plus the Department of Environment, and to identify any gaps or services.

The city of Chicago should explore sustainable revenue sources to maintain its environmental department in the long term. This study will scope out the functions of the department and identify gaps and areas where capacity can be built. It is important that this study is fully funded in order to provide guidance on how to best move forward with environmental protection in the city.

The Commissioner for the Department of Human Services wants to make sure that funding is used efficiently to prevent violence and engage youth in activities, rather than wasted on unnecessary costs like the $65 million spent on McCormack place. They plan to look into using public facilities more effectively and creating private-public partnerships that are more cost-effective for taxpayers.

The city has budgeted for upgrading and improving public facilities, and for the social programming of agencies like CPS. However, there is concern about the level of coordination between these agencies, especially when it comes to addressing youth mental health.

The city of Chicago is committed to improving its mental health facilities and has increased access to mental health services. By the end of the year, there will be a mental health site in every one of the city's 77 communities.

The city of Chicago has released a climate action plan and allocated funding to climate and environmental justice priorities. The goal is to make the planet better and help save the environment.

The city of Chicago has been working hard to allocate its $1 million green jobs fund equitably to its communities. They have also been working on a citywide compost network and expanding their tree planting efforts.

The Department of Environment is working on a community benefits agreement that will put money back into community and workforce development. They are also exploring the possibility of a permanent department structure. This is a complicated issue that involves multiple departments.

The City of Chicago is requesting a study on the feasibility of creating a Department of the Environment, in light of the climate crisis. This department would be responsible for sustainability investments and decarbonization efforts. Alderman Mitchell is in favor of this proposal and believes it would be a great step in combating the climate crisis.

The City Council has passed seven items on the agenda, with Item 8 concerning expenditures of 2023 to be explained by budget director Susie Park. There is a motion to approve Item 9, an intergovernmental agreement with the Chicago Transit Authority, which will allocate $3 million from the city's motor fuel tax funds to the CTA.

The City Council is voting on a measure that will provide $5 million in funding to the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA). Alderman Tunney says that this funding is required by the Regional Transportation Act, and Alderman Harrison says that the CTA president has been asked to appear before the City Council for several months. Alderman Cardenas says he will vote for the measure because the CTA president has committed to appearing before the City Council.

This ordinance establishes the new office of climate and environmental equity and requires that a study be commissioned to determine the most effective way to reduce environmental disparities.

The proposed bill would establish a department responsible for environmental policymaking and operations, allow the community commission for public safety and accountability to submit only one eligible candidate for reappointment, give diverse the same meaning as minority in order to expand the definition, and end the sunset provision for one million dollars emergency procurement authority belonging to the chief procurement officer.

This ordinance clarifies language related to debt checks and payment plans for applicants for city employees employment. It also authorizes the department of public health to abate public nuisances on land with missing or unresponsive owners. Furthermore, it consolidates all short-term rental company licensing under the intermediary license by eliminating the platform license.

The city of Chicago is requiring lobbyists to cooperate with the city in its efforts to improve transparency and accountability. This requirement already exists elsewhere in the code, and this change is simply aligning this section to match that.

The city has the authority to compel lobbyists to cooperate with the inspector general, and the mayor shall select a candidate or reject the candidates for reappointment to the police board within 30 days.

The term "diverse" has been proposed as a replacement for "minority", but this could exclude certain groups that are meant to be included under the term "minority".

The city is considering changing the process for volunteers to include a debt check application instead of an affidavit. The goal is to make the process more modern and easier for people. The comptroller clarified that this would not apply to volunteers who are part of a commission.

The city of Chicago is expanding the definition of "worker" to include independent contractors and those who may not be considered employees in order to better protect their rights. Violations of the new law will be adjudicated by the Department of Labor Standards or a judge in circuit court.

The city is proposing a new fee for short-term rental companies that would be $250 per company, plus $60 for each host. This is in addition to the existing license fee that these companies already pay.

The city of Chicago is proposing a new fee for platforms that allow people to rent out their properties, like Airbnb. This fee would be paid by the platform, not the individual owner of the property. The city is concerned that there are many platforms that are not legally registered and wants to make sure that all platforms are paying the appropriate fees.

The individual unit owners only registered with the companies and back then we we it was just chaos we didn't know the companies were now reporting to the city of chicago so we as a department brought in all of the various individual registrations from all the various platforms for instance airbnb when they register with us bacp that host the actual property owner the renter pays us 125 and they can do whatever they want the rest of the year in terms of uh licensing it out to their customers you you're still not i'm it it seems to me that the answer is that if you are not affiliated with a platform this does not apply okay that's right correct correct i'm just i'm just trying to protect the citizens that are you know the mrs johnson in my ward that rents to a student that she doesn't end up having to pay if she's unaffiliated with the platform she got it then i have no further questions thank you thank you alderman riley thank you madam chairman and alderman harriston covered most of mine i do have um two questions and and obviously you've heard my feelings What the alderman is saying is that if an individual rents out their property to somebody (such as through Airbnb), they have to pay a registration fee. However, if they are not affiliated with a platform (such as Airbnb), they do not have to pay the fee.

The city council is considering making the emergency procurement authority of the chief procurement officer (CPO) a permanent power. The CPO would have the authority to make emergency procurements of up to a million dollars without council approval. The rationale for this is that costs have increased significantly in recent years and the CPO needs the flexibility to make quick decisions in order to get the best prices for goods and services.

The city council is discussing a proposal to give the city's emergency powers permanently, which would remove the city council's oversight on many decisions. One council member asks about the universe of decisions that would be made without the council's input, and another asks about platforms that list short-term rentals. The commissioner says they will provide a list of the platforms to the council.

The alderman brought up a good point about the budget and how it affects the taxpayers. They also mentioned that a disparity study should be done in order to make sure that the budget is fair.

The budget includes salaries for three individuals - city clerk, city treasurer, and mayor - but only the city clerk and city treasurer salaries are being adjusted. The change will start in 2023, after May 15th, and will be based on the CPI (Consumer Price Index). The mayor's salary will not change until 2024.

Aldermen are discussing whether or not to give a CPI adjustment to persons every year. Some aldermen believe in doing so, while others do not. The discussion is tabled for five minutes so that the law department can check if the substitute has been modified.
