The City of Chicago is proposing an ordinance that would require contractors to hire a certain percentage of socioeconomically disadvantaged workers for construction projects. The proposed amendment to the ordinance removes the project area residency requirement and replaces it with a new requirement that the total hours worked on the project must be performed by residents of social economically disadvantaged areas. The ordinance being discussed is for the hiring of construction workers for a project in a socially disadvantaged area. The community that is hosting the project should have first consideration for the workforce, but if there are not enough residents from that area that meet the requirements, then workers from other socially disadvantaged areas in the city can be hired.

The city of Chicago is discussing an ordinance that would give preference to socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals when awarding construction contracts. The project area would be defined as the area where the construction project is taking place, and "project area resident" would be defined as a person who lives in the part of the city designated as the project area in the information for bidders issued by the Department of Procurement Services. This allows for a more objective view of who is considered a project area resident, rather than relying on the Department of Planning's definition.

Alderman Villegas has proposed an ordinance that would raise the threshold for city contracts in an effort to increase equity in hiring. The ordinance would require contractors doing business with the city to hire a certain percentage of employees from disadvantaged backgrounds. Some colleagues are concerned that this could unintentionally exclude certain populations.

The city council received feedback on the proposed substitute ordinance and plans to address it in a future ordinance. No action was taken on the proposed ordinance at this time.
