The director of the center, Paul Naranjo, testified that the center is currently in 14 different sites located throughout the Chicago land area and surrounding communities and that the project of South Chicago has been brought to the organization as a new adventure based on the need of the community and the increase in violence and number of people from under served communities who were left out on their own after many clinics were closed.

The city of Chicago is selling a property to a church for $90,000, and giving a mental health provider a building for $1. Some people question whether this is fair, given that taxpayers are responsible for funding many other things.

The City of Chicago has leased a property to a nonprofit organization for 10 years.

The City Council is considering approving the sale of a city-owned property at 621 East 45th Street to More Love Word Church.

The answer is no, the city does not take into consideration any credits when selling land to a church.

The city is selling land to a church for a dollar. The councilmember supports this because the church provides public service to the community. However, another councilmember questions whether the city has a policy of selling land to churches for a dollar, and asks that the matter be looked into.

The issue of whether or not to give credits to those who maintain adjacent lots is being discussed. It is known that residents who maintain vacant lots are often asked to pay full price for them, and it is hoped that this will be looked into further. There is also discussion of a church that has been given favoritism in the form of a discount on a lot purchase, and it is hoped that this will be corrected. Finally, the process for negotiating sales is clarified as being a collaborative decision between planners and others.
