The petitioner, Lorie Smith, is a artist who creates custom messages using words and graphics. The respondent, Colorado, has declared her speech a public accommodation and insists that she create and speak messages that violate her conscience. The Supreme Court is being asked to apply its precedent to this case.

The conversation is about whether or not the case is ripe. Ms. Waggoner argues that it is ripe because the parties have stipulated every message that Ms. Smith would create has a unique, customized message and that it celebrates a wedding and celebrates a marriage. She also argues that Colorado has a history of aggressive enforcement against Ms. Smith, which has chilled her speech for six years.

Amber creates websites for same-sex couples. If she decides she no longer wants to do this, she cannot be compelled to continue.

The conversation is about whether a website designer can refuse to design a website for a same-sex couple on the basis of her religious beliefs. The Supreme Court has already recognized that there is a difference of opinion on the issue of marriage, and the designer is arguing that she should not be required to express a view that violates her conscience. Justice Kagan points out that the refusal is not based on the content of the speech, but on the fact that the couple is same-sex.

The speaker is arguing that the content of the website is not the issue, it is the message that the website is sending by being used in a same-sex marriage.

The conversation is about a wedding website designer who is being sued for refusing to create a website for a same-sex couple. The designer argues that she should not be forced to create speech that she disagrees with. The justices ask whether there are any limits to this argument, and the designer says that she should not be forced to sell her services to anyone she disagrees with.

In the conversation, the participants discuss whether or not a website designer can refuse to provide services to a same-sex couple. Under the Hurley framework, it is unlikely that someone would only refuse to serve black Americans in an interracial marriage context. However, even if the website designer could not refuse to provide services to a same-sex couple, it would not be applicable to the case at hand.

The Supreme Court is hearing a case about whether a wedding website violates the Compelled Speech Doctrine by compelling speech from the couple. Justice Sotomayor is questioning the attorney for the website, asking her to show how the website is anything other than the story of the couple. The attorney cannot provide a satisfactory answer.

The conversation is about whether or not a wedding website author has to publish a story that is inconsistent with her biblical views about marriage. The conclusion is that she would have to publish it.

Ms. Waggoner is arguing that a baker should not be forced to create a website that would violate her religious beliefs about marriage. She says that the baker would not be compelled to create a website that would say that concepts of gender or sexual orientation are irrelevant to a relationship.

The conversation is about the line between a person's right to free speech and the government's ability to compel speech. In this case, the question is whether a website designer can be forced to create a website that advocates for same-sex marriage, even if they don't agree with that view. Justices Gorsuch and Kagan are questioning whether the website designer's speech is their own speech or the speech of the couple getting married. Colorado has said in the past that cake makers don't have to make cakes that advocate against same-sex marriage, because that would be the cake maker's speech, not just the couple's speech. The question is how to draw a line between free speech and compelled speech in a way that is clear and consistent.

The conversation is about whether or not the government can protect speech that is objectionable. Ms. Waggoner argues that if the objection is contained in the message, it is protected speech and the government can't do anything about it. Justice Sotomayor argues that if the message is identical but from a disabled couple, it should still be protected speech. Ms. Waggoner argues that what matters is the objection to the message, not the identity of the speaker.

The conversation discuss the line between compelled speech and compelled service. Justice Sotomayor asks if the person viewing the work will think is talking. Ms. Wagganer responds that the Pulitzer Prize goes to the photographer, and that the reason is because they are requiring that artist to speak a message. The conversation then turns to a hypothetical about race and selling to someone of a different race.

The business wants to express its own view of nostalgia about Christmases past by reproducing classic 1940s and 1950s Santa scenes. They do it in sepia tone and they are customizing each one. This is not off a rack. They're really bringing the people in and having them interact with Santa, children, because they're trying to capture the feelings of a certain era. But precisely because they're trying to capture the feelings of a certain era, their policy is that only white children can be photographed with Santa in this way because that's how they view the scenes with Santa that they're trying to depict.

The conversation is about whether or not a web designer can refuse to take photos of black, Hispanic, and Asian children for a Christmas website. The web designer believes that they should be able to refuse because the children are not of the same race as Santa. However, the other justices point out that the message of the website is not clear, and that the web designer may be engaging in racial discrimination.

The Court is discussing whether or not religious objections to same-sex marriage are the same as religious objections to people of color. The answer is no, according to Obergefell. However, the Court is struggling to find a way to draw the line between gay marriage and other types of discrimination.

The conversation is between Justice Sotomayor and Ms. Waggoner, a lawyer. Justice Sotomayor is questioning Ms. Waggoner about why she should be allowed to refuse service to a gay couple. Ms. Waggoner argues that the Compelled Speech Doctrine does not apply in this case because the speech is already in the public domain. She also argues that there are 20 states that have filed an amicus brief in support of her position.

The lawyer for a Colorado baker who refused to make a cake for a gay couple's wedding argues that her client's actions are protected speech under the First Amendment. Justice Sotomayor points out that the baker is essentially saying that she does not want to serve gay couples, just as a restaurant in a previous case said it did not want to serve black people. The lawyer argues that the baker is not trying to send a message through her conduct, but Justice Sotomayor says that she is being asked to shape her speech by a third party.

The Chief Justice asks whether a website that is only available to heterosexual couples could be constitutionally be applied under the Colorado statute. The lawyer for the case responds that the speech could be compelled if the only indication of any limitation was a tag line at the end saying these services are for heterosexual couples only. The Chief Justice then asks what if the website said that it would not provide services for anything other than heterosexual marriages because of religious reasons. The lawyer responds that the religious basis is not determinative here and that the Compelled Speech Doctrine applies in a host of situations and cases that are not religious.

The Supreme Court is hearing a case about a wedding photographer who refused to serve a same-sex couple. The photographer argues that she should be allowed to refuse service based on her religious beliefs. The justices are questioning whether the photographer's religious beliefs should take precedence over the couple's right to equal treatment.

The conversation is between Justice Kagan and Ms. Waggoner, who is representing a client who owns a website design company. The client believes that same-sex weddings contradict scripture and refuses to design a website for such a wedding. Justice Kagan asks what speech is required of the client that would violate the First Amendment, and Ms. Waggoner responds that the client believes same-sex weddings are a concept of marriage that she believes to be false.

In the conversation, the person providing the chairs for a wedding is compared to someone providing speech. It is argued that even though the person providing the chairs is not explicitly providing speech, they are still engaging in symbolic speech. Furthermore, it is argued that the Compelled Speech Doctrine should protect individuals from being forced to speak messages that betray their conscience.

The conversation is between Justice Gorsuch and Ms. Waggoner, who is representing a client who refused to make a cake for a same-sex wedding. Ms. Waggoner explains that her client objects to same-sex marriage on religious grounds, and that she has declined other projects based on the message that have nothing to do with same-sex marriage. Justice Gorsuch asks if the objection is to the person or the message, and Ms. Waggoner says it is always to the message.

The conversation is between two people discussing a court case involving gay marriage. One person argues that website designers should not be compared to restaurants or caterers because they are creating speech, while the other person argues that everyone should be able to speak under Colorado's theory.

The conversation is between two lawyers discussing a case involving a website designer who was asked to design a website for a same-sex couple, but refused on the grounds of religious beliefs. The first lawyer argues that the designer should not be forced to design the website because it would violate their right to free speech. The second lawyer argues that the designer does not have a right to free speech in this case because they are refusing to serve an entire class of people.

The conversation is about whether or not someone who designs websites can refuse to sell a website to a same-sex couple. The person arguing that they should be able to refuse says that it's different than just selling a product, because the website is customized for each couple.

The artist would not be able to object if the song were used at a same-sex wedding, as it would be in the "stream of commerce."

The artist in this case is a freelancer who provides customized services to anyone who pays her. However, she refuses to provide services to people whose messages she disagrees with. The question is whether she can be compelled to provide services to those people in 19 jurisdictions that have political ideology laws.

The speaker in this conversation is discussing whether or not it is constitutionally permissible to sell a product (in this case, food) that is only available to people of a certain religion. The speaker argues that since the product is not actually expressive (i.e. the recipe is not based on any religious message), it should be permissible. However, the person they are speaking to argues that the act of selling the product is itself an act of expression, and therefore would be unconstitutional.

The conversation is about whether or not a photographer would be required to take a Santa photo with minority children if they objected to it. The answer is that it depends on the context and whether or not the objection lines up with the message the photographer is trying to convey.

The speaker is arguing that, as a photography business owner, they have the right to free speech and can therefore refuse to sell certain products to non-white individuals.

The Supreme Court is hearing a case about whether a Colorado law requiring businesses to provide equal access to their services violates the First Amendment. The company that is challenging the law claims that it targets expression, but the state argues that it only targets the company's discriminatory sales practices.

This case is about a web design company that is refusing to sell its services to a same-sex couple. The company is arguing that this is a free speech issue and that they should be exempt from public accommodation laws. However, the Supreme Court has previously ruled that public accommodation laws apply to all businesses, regardless of their type of service. Therefore, the company should not be exempt from these laws.

In the conversation, the justices are discussing whether public accommodation laws can be applied to speech. Mr. Olson argues that there is no history of people raising First Amendment speech objections to these laws. Justice Thomas is interested in whether there is a tradition of public accommodation laws regulating speech. Mr. Olson argues that there is no such tradition.

The attorney for the plaintiff in Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission is arguing that the company should not be required to serve customers who request cakes for events that the company disagrees with, on the basis that doing so would violate the company's freedom of speech. The Chief Justice points out that in a previous case involving foster care and adoption, the court ruled that individualized determinations are not the same as requiring a company to provide a service.

The Chief Justice asks Mr. Olson, the lawyer for the cake shop, how the Rumsfeld v. FAIR case helps their argument. Mr. Olson responds that in the FAIR case, the speech was found to be incidental to the regulation, and that sometimes the speech itself does not change.

The Supreme Court is hearing a case about a same-sex couple who was denied service from a wedding website company. The company is arguing that they should be allowed to deny service to same-sex couples because it is their right to free speech.

The conversation is between two people discussing a law that states businesses cannot discriminate based on sexual orientation. The first person asks if a website designer who puts a message on their website that they do not serve same-sex couples is violating the law. The second person responds that the website designer is not violating the law because they are not turning away same-sex couples, they are just choosing what services to offer. The first person asks if it makes any difference in the real world. The second person responds that it does because the website designer will lose business from opposite-sex couples as well.

In the conversation, the Justices are trying to determine whether a website designer who only provides services to certain people based on their demand is considered a public accommodation. Mr. Olson argues that as long as the website designer is not discriminating based on protected characteristics, then they are allowed to choose their clientele.

The conversation is about whether a website can be considered a public accommodation if it is selective in the content it publishes.

A Jewish man and a Christian woman who are engaged to be married ask a Jewish website designer to build a website to celebrate their nuptials. The website designer explains that many Jews consider intermarriage an existential threat to the future of Judaism, and so the website would need to accept the second couple. However, if the website is offered mostly or exclusively to Jews, then the designer would not be required to sell it to the interreligious couple.

The conversation is about whether or not a Jewish photographer would have to take a photograph for an ashleymadison.com dating profile if asked. Justice Alito suggests that the photographer would probably have to do it, depending on the services they offer to the public.

A gay couple walks into Ms. Smith's office and asks for a quote from Obergefell. Ms. Smith says she doesn't do that, and the gay couple asks why not. Ms. Smith says it's because she doesn't do it for anybody. The gay couple asks if she would say it if they were an opposite-sex couple, and Ms. Smith says she would. The gay couple asks what the big deal is then, and Ms. Smith says she thinks it's different in part because it implicates the very compelling free exercise concerns of the vendor, which aren't present in this case.

The conversation is about a hypothetical situation in which a dating website provides a statement about the nature of a marriage, and whether or not that would be considered speech. Mr. Olson agrees that it would be difficult to determine if the statement is fact or opinion, but if it is solely based on the status of the person seeking the website, then it is an easier question.

The conversation discuss the argument that opposition to same-sex marriage is equivalent to opposition to interracial marriage. Mr. Olson argues that this is the case when it comes to the law, but that people are entitled to their own views on the matter.

In the conversation, Justice Alito asks Mr. Olson if he thinks it would be honorable to discriminate on the basis of race, and Mr. Olson says no. Justice Alito then gives a hypothetical situation in which a person is forced to write vows or speeches that espouse things they loathe, and Mr. Olson says that they cannot be forced to do that because it's not a protected characteristic.

In the conversation, the justices discuss whether a business can refuse to serve a customer based on race, sex, religion, or sexual orientation. Mr. Olson argues that there is no protected characteristic anywhere that would allow for this type of discrimination. The justices question whether this would fall under another statute, to which Mr. Olson replies that under any level of scrutiny, the state has a compelling interest in protecting against discrimination.

In the conversation, Mr. Olson and Justice Gorsuch discuss a case involving a cake shop that refused to serve a same-sex couple. Mr. Olson argues that the cake shop should be allowed to refuse service because the cake is an expressive activity. Justice Gorsuch disagrees, arguing that the cake is not expressive activity and that the cake shop should not be allowed to refuse service.

In the conversation, the question is raised whether a freelance writer who is a public accommodation (under Colorado law) can refuse to write a press release for a religious entity with whom the writer disagrees. It is concluded that such a refusal would be permissible.

This conversation is about whether Colorado can compel a person to sell a product that the person finds offensive to their religious beliefs. The answer is no, Colorado cannot compel the person to sell the product.

The difference between the two cases is that the company has chosen to say they want to provide wedding websites generally, and they will not provide one that celebrates a particular thing that the individual finds offends her religious beliefs.

In the conversation, the Justices are discussing whether or not a company can refuse to sell a product to a same-sex couple based on religious beliefs. Justice Gorsuch asks if the company's religious beliefs can be changed, and Mr. Olson responds that in Colorado, the company would have to go through a process to ensure they are familiar with the state's law.

The conversation is between Justice Gorsuch and Mr. Olson. They are discussing Colorado's education program and whether or not it violates the First Amendment. Mr. Olson believes it does not, but Justice Gorsuch is not convinced. Chief Justice Roberts then asks Justice Kavanaugh for his opinion. Justice Kavanaugh asks Mr. Olson what he thinks Colorado's position on the First Amendment could lead to in terms of a publishing house discriminating against certain authors based on their beliefs. Mr. Olson responds that a publishing house would still have a First Amendment right to do so, even if it were a public accommodation.

In the conversation, the justices are discussing whether or not a website designer is violating Colorado law by refusing to publish gay authors. The website designer argues that they should not be required to publish content that goes against their beliefs. However, the justices point out that the website designer is essentially engaging in compelled speech by forcing them to say something that they do not believe.

The Supreme Court is hearing a case about whether a company can refuse to provide the same service to a customer solely based on who they are. Justice Barrett asks whether a newspaper can refuse to print heterosexual marriage announcements during gay pride month in order to promote same-sex marriage, and the answer is yes.

The question is whether a business can discriminate based on a protected characteristic when choosing which marriage announcements to publish. Mr. Olson argues that businesses typically have a great deal of discretion in this area, but that if the sole basis for discrimination is a protected characteristic, then it would not be allowed.

In the conversation, the justices are discussing whether or not a gay rights organization can be forced to publish announcements for opposite-sex marriages. Mr. Olson argues that if the organization is considered a public accommodation, then they would not be able to discriminate against any protected characteristic, including opposite-sex marriage announcements.

This conversation is about the case of Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, in which a bakery refused to make a cake for a same-sex couple's wedding. The conversation discuss whether this refusal is protected under the First Amendment. Justice Barrett asks whether the bakery can refuse service on the basis of sexual orientation, and Mr. Olson responds that they can do that but only if they are willing to turn away all customers who are gay or lesbian.

In the conversation, the justices discuss whether or not a baker can be forced to make a cake for a gay couple if it goes against their religious beliefs. They also discuss how this ruling could potentially affect other situations involving public accommodations.

The question at hand is whether or not a web designer can be forced to include a statement on a website that marriage is only between one man and one woman if the company they work for holds that belief. The stipulations in this case do not address that question, so it is wide open.

The conversation discuss the implications of the First Amendment on public accommodations laws. Specifically, the question is whether or not a web designer can refuse to create a website for a same-sex wedding if it goes against their religious beliefs. It is noted that if this were the case, then any provider of expressive services could put up a sign saying they do not serve people with particular characteristics if they believe that serving those people would change their message.

The speaker explains that the Supreme Court's decision in Rumsfeld v. FAIR was based on the fact that the law schools in that case were required to provide the same speech and services to the military as they would to any other recruiter, and that this was incidental to a content-neutral regulation of conduct.

The conversation discuss the case of a Colorado baker who refused to make a cake for a same-sex couple's wedding. The baker argues that she should not be compelled to create a cake that goes against her religious beliefs. The Supreme Court justices ask whether this is different from other cases where businesses are required to provide services to all customers regardless of race, religion, or sex.

The conversation is about the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy, which prevented recruiters from discriminating against LGBTQ+ individuals. The policy was deeply objectionable to law schools, who felt that it violated their principles of nondiscrimination. The question is whether the law schools would have to provide the same services to the military that they do to other employers, including helping them craft statements about why a career in the military is attractive. If they did, then they would have to do the same for everyone, which would be a burden.

The conversation is between two people discussing a case. The first person argues that the case is like Hurley, where the Supreme Court ruled that a public accommodations law could not be applied to a parade because it would be a direct burden on speech. The second person argues that the case is more like FAIR, where the Court ruled that a public accommodations law could be applied to a university because it would be an incidental burden on speech.

The conversation is between two people discussing a website for a couple's wedding. The website includes a countdown to the wedding day, as well as information about the ceremony, reception, and menu. The person reviewing the website does not see anything that celebrates the marriage or mentions God.

The conversation is between Chief Justice Roberts and Mr. Fletcher regarding the accommodations law in Colorado. Mr. Fletcher is arguing that the law should exempt Ms. Smith, who has a status-based exemption, because her religious beliefs would be unmistakable to the public after viewing her website. Chief Justice Roberts is questioning whether or not the stipulations regarding Ms. Smith's willingness to work with all people regardless of classification should be taken into account.

The conversation is between Justices Gorsuch and Jackson, and Mr. Fletcher. They are discussing whether or not a same-sex couple should be provided a wedding website by a business owner who disagrees with same-sex marriage. Fletcher argues that this would be a form of discrimination, and Gorsuch asks if this work is expressive in nature. Jackson then asks a hypothetical about a photographer, to which Fletcher responds that if the principle is that the work is expressive and the message has changed, then anyone should be exempt from public accommodations laws.

The conversation is about a photographer who does not want to take pictures of Santa with children because he feels it is inconsistent with his beliefs. The question is whether or not this photographer can be forced to take these pictures.

The conversation is about whether a Christian organization can be compelled to publish an announcement for a same-sex couple's marriage. Mr. Fletcher argues that the organization does not have to because the refusal is not based on status. Justice Barrett asks why it is different in this case, where the status of the club is inextricably intertwined with the message they want to speak. Mr. Fletcher says it is for a couple of reasons, one being that the Court has recognized that same-sex marriage is a circumstance where status and conduct are inextricably intertwined.

The speaker argues that discrimination against gays and lesbians should not be allowed under public accommodations laws, because the expression of particular views is not inextricably intertwined with having a particular religion or being a Democrat or a Republican.

This conversation is about whether or not it is permissible for a website to include a statement that marriage is only between one man and one woman. Mr. Fletcher believes that it is permissible, while Mr. Olson believes that it would cause the website to lose business.

The conversation is about whether a state can broadly define a public accommodation, and whether there are limits to how far the state can go in defining what is a sufficiently substantial interest to justify scrutiny under the O'Brien test.

The conversation is about whether or not a state can define what constitutes an impermissible denial of service. The answer is that a state can define its public accommodations laws however it wants, but when it starts to bump up against the First Amendment, the interests supported by such a prohibition would be weaker.

This is a conversation about whether a business can discriminate against customers based on the business owner's beliefs. Mr. Fletcher argues that a business should be able to refuse service if the owner has a religious or moral objection to the customer's request. Justice Kagan asks whether this would also apply to a business owner who objects to gay marriage, and Mr. Fletcher says yes.

The conversation is between Justice Kagan and Mr. Fletcher. They are discussing a hypothetical case in which a woman is asked to say "God bless this union" as part of her job. Justice Kagan says that she would come out one way if the woman was only asked to say the words, but she might come out the other way if the woman was being asked to do something else as part of her job.

The conversation discuss a case in which a woman is refusing to provide websites for same-sex marriages. The woman is seeking an injunction that would allow her to continue this practice. However, the conversation participants discuss whether or not this type of relief is appropriate.

The lawyer for the state of Washington is arguing that the state should be allowed to ban gay marriage because it is a form of expression that the state does not agree with. He says that if the Court rules against the state, then it would be open to schools teaching segregation as long as they can claim it is part of their message.

The conversation is between Justice Gorsuch and Mr. Fletcher. Justice Gorsuch begins by stating that there is radical agreement on how to legally analyze the case, and that what would be impermissible is discrimination on the basis of status. Mr. Fletcher disagrees, saying that there is great difference of opinion about how to legally answer the case. Justice Gorsuch then asks if it is fair to say that the other side thinks it is a viewpoint case, to which Mr. Fletcher responds that it is both a status and message case.

The conversation is about whether or not a burden imposed on a person is incidental to a content-neutral regulation. The first question is whether or not the person is discriminating based on status. If the answer is yes, then the burden is incidental even if the person thinks it affects them.

The conversation is between Justice Gorsuch and Mr. Fletcher regarding the case of Ms. Smith, a Colorado baker who refused to make a cake for a same-sex wedding. Justice Gorsuch asks whether the outcome would be different if the protected status was changed, and Mr. Fletcher responds that it would still be discrimination. Justice Kavanaugh then asks about a hypothetical in which Muslim filmmakers are required to promote Scientology, and Mr. Fletcher says that it would still be discrimination.

This conversation is about a hypothetical situation in which a writer is being forced to write a speech that violates their deeply held convictions. The question is whether or not this hypothetical situation is the same as the case at hand, in which a speech-writing business is being required to apply a public accommodations law. Fletcher argues that the two situations are not the same, because in the hypothetical situation, the writer is being directly compelled to write something they disagree with, while in the case at hand, the speech-writing business is only being required to follow a content-neutral law.

The speaker argues that speech writers are not likely to be considered public accommodations, and even if they were, a state would have to "wander from" the core public accommodations laws in order to violate the Constitution.

The speaker is discussing a case in which a designer is refusing to create products that implicitly endorse gay marriage. The speaker argues that the designer should be allowed to do this, as long as she is not discriminating based on status.

The Chief Justice and Justice Jackson question the United States' counsel on the issue of compelled speech in the case of Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. The United States concedes that marriage is a message, and that the First Amendment already provides protection for message-based speech. However, they argue that the petitioner in this case is seeking a categorical denial of service, which is not allowed. Chief Justice Roberts asks about the case of FAIR v. Rumsfeld, and the United States argues that this case is closer to that one.

The conversation is about the case FAIR v. Rumsfeld, in which the court is considering whether or not the government can compel speech that violates someone's convictions. The participants discuss whether or not the law schools that advocated for the "don't ask, don't tell" policy are in a different space than the creator of the message, and whether or not the government would have unfettered authority to compel speech if Third-party perceptions could not possibly matter. They also discuss how the definition of public accommodation is broad, and how it would take away First Amendment rights just for opening a business. Finally, they talk about how religious speech is not protected under this law, and how the bright line is whether or not the message is affected.

The conversation is about the Compelled Speech Doctrine, which prohibits the government from forcing people to say things against their will. The speaker argues that this principle should apply to all forms of speech, including artistic expression.

This conversation is about a court case. The person speaking is asking the court to reverse its decision. They believe that self-government and the pursuit of truth are foundational to our society.
